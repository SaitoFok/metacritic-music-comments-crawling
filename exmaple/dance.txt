Wow this was terrible not even remotely close to the drake we love and know it’s literally bad lyrics and dance music from like gta strip clubs
As much as I appreciate Drake taking a risk and switching up his style, this just isn't what I wanted to hear. Drake's singing on some of these tracks (especially "Falling Back") is absolutely abominable. The majority of the beats sound bland, and I feel like Drake really offers less substantive lyrics than ever before. That being said, some of the songs actually provide a pretty nice moody vibe and are just fun to listen to when you're spending time with your thoughts at night. Drake, however, vocally and lyrically offers little to nothing to these songs so that their appeal mostly come down to the beats or the instrumentals. Overall just another project that Drake seemingly didn't put in much effort for. His cruise on autopilot continues, even if he slightly altered his course by turning to more of a house music kind of style.
"Honestly, Nevermind". My thoughts exactly when I hoped this album would be at least a decent Drake project. The album sounds like a 52 minute version of Get It Together. The production is dry, the bars are extreme cringe, and the delivery is flatter than a board. This is easily the worst Drake has ever been. The only thing saving this album from a 0/10 is the final track which, while pretty generic, was much better than the rest of the album. Drake must've lost a bet in the NBA finals with the Celtics and this was their punishment for it.
Lazy. Drake is still auto-piloting, but this time over generic dance beats. Nothing sounds awful, just very uninspired and dull.
Dear Americans, grow up and get hold of some vibes. Go to a beach, put this album on the speakers and start dancing.- A fellow European
I love albums where each song rolls into the next. Each song also tells a part of a simple story
Drake finally took some big risks and focused on one cohesive sound. On the last few projects, he was stuck in a routine of trying to please every type of fan he has, and he ended up with bloated, formulaic albums that tried to do too much at once. This time, he picked one lane (singing over dance music) and fully committed himself to it, pushing himself out of his usual formula. I never thought we’d get a cohesive 14-song album from Drake again—especially one with this much experimentation—and I’m very happy with the surprise. He finally stopped trying to appease all his fans
i never really liked drake, but even I can tell this album is gass without the g.album felt very lazy and sounds like it was made in garage band on an iphone 6.
An average album, very average, compared to "Scorpion", "Views" and so on. Drake really stopped being an artist. The only track that "services" is "Sticky"
one of the most boring albums since the start of this decade, extremely generic and uninspired
This is Drake’s most pop centric album since Views, and comes just 9 months after he released the much awaited CLB. It also lacks many features, with the only one being 21 Savage on Jimmy Cook’s, which I think is the best song. It’s a pretty generic album, with most of the songs following a simple and similar tempo. Drake leans into his singing side more than his rapping side, and while he’s talented at both I prefer one more than the other. I think this album will divide Drake fans because of how far he leans one way. Worth a listen but nothing special.
I really liked the vibe of the album. it's a pretty good upgrade after that CLB disaster. obviously he's trying to get back to what he used to be; an innovative artist and I think it's working. there are some junk tracks again but just a few, overall it's good.
What’s frustrating is everyone calling this a bad album. I think it’s a great album with production dedicated for a summer. I throughly enjoyed most tracks.
I suggest Black Coffee work with a better artist next time. Idea around a house album is great, execution is not. Another L for Drake.
I’ve been waiting a long time for drake to try something new, and I’m very happy with the outcome.
The best album from Drake, he really left his comfort zone with this project and he did incredible.
Despite the more interesting, housier beats, this album has some of the blandest, least interesting performances drake has ever put to tape.
An album that really didn't need to be made at all with very bland vocals and house beats. Some of the songs sound very uninspired and all over the place. It's just a very strange and confusing album and I am not sure why someone like Drake a huge name in the industry couldn't connect with those who could help better or push the sound he wanted. I admire Drake wanting to move into new territory but there is almost no excuse, especially considering how well connected he is. Anyone that's giving this album a 10 is full of delusion and fanboyism. This is probably the most generic bland album I have ever listened to in my entire life
This album is so mediocre boring and bland I couldn’t even Believe he released this half baked project
Another lacklustre Drake Album, who could’ve seen that coming?Anyways, incredibly boring, overly repetitive, and drawn out songs that really aren’t anything new from Drake and definitely hard to sit through. This album would’ve seriously benefitted from much shorter songs, and a much shorter track list. It would still be underwhelming, but it would be much better.The only song that’s worth it is the last one with 21 Savage. At least Drake shows some energy on this track, and 21 kills his verse. Other than that, this album isn’t worth it.Ever since the release of Scorpion, Drake has been getting lazier and lazier, and that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. Until he pulls his head out of his ass and starts to puts some effort into his music again, I’ll be listening to If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
Clássico álbum do Drake. É a cara do quão medíocre e superestimado é ele.É o perfil do álbum feito pra ter alguns hits e ganhar engajamento principalmente em dancinha de TikTok ou algo do tipo.Fora 1 ou 2 músicas que tem sua qualidade, o resto é muito, muito medíocre. Impressionante como Drake tem 35 anos mas não tem maturidade suficiente pra fazer letras que sejam profundas o bastante pra ultrapassar um aluno do nono ano do colégio que faz aula de poesia.Medíocre, é a definição do álbum. Mas mesmo assim, melhor que o chorume que foi CLB. Parabéns pela "evolução" Drake!
It's not very good. I get what he was trying to do, but my god did he fail. It's okay to try something new, Ye did it with 808s and again with Yeezus, but Drake is no Ye. Drake's strength comes from his easy-to-listen-to rap. It was nothing truly exceptional, but it sold. Drake was never groundbreaking, he didn't have to be. This, however, is not very good. It's generic, trite, and all-around disappointing.
WOW, this album is BAD! After Certified Lover Boy, which I thought was extremely meh, I would've thought Drake would put in SOME effort to make a good album. Guess I was wrong, this is one of the laziest albums I've ever heard.
What a mid release nothing superior about it all good but there’s no hits soongs like his another albums
This is legit garbage lol. Dude is just releasing to release and is just singing over bland music beats. Really unoriginal
This is probably one of the worst albums in 2022, underwhelming music. Drake should've spent more time with this record, to try and make it a little more... listenable.
This is honestly just straight bad....dude hasn't put out a decent album in a while now.
The album is a refreshing change of paces from Drake as his prior project begun to feel safe without any true risk with experimentation. House music is rooted in Black culture dating back to Chicago and Detroit with pioneers such as Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy. Drake's take on House music is fun, light, and energetic.The overall album is his most cohesive since NWTS or Take Care. In 5-years from now, it would be hard to not place this project in with his best bodies of work. 10/10 for a strong body of work that is completely out of Drake's comfort zone.
I wish he did 'honestly nevermind'. This album is so boring that it serves as a vacuum for your energy. It has been 7 years since Drake made a good album, I wonder if we will ever see another one.
Bad house, bad Drake, but a lazily crapped out album that Stans will insist is something new and revolutionary.
… the goat i can’t even fathom the greatness we are witnessing. drake tapped into a new scene of music and these tracks will be mixed to death at every festival, club, etc… he really done it
Quite a surprise of an album with a great vibe for the summer, nothing exceptional but I feel like this album will grow on a lot of people.
This is one of the albums ever, it had production, it had lyrics, and it’s the first ever album to have over 1 lesbillion digital sales and streaming, this takes hiphop to while new level that even kendrick can’t top it, you only need this in your album collection or better ifnot or it will entirely ruined your album hype going around the corner #honestlynevermindsweep
For an artist like Drake, who has perfected an album formula designed for chart domination and party ubiquity, this is a surprise album in every sense of the term.Largely a departure from rap, HN finds Drake crooning passionately over house beats, making for some of the most refreshing and interesting music of his record-breaking career.While it’s sure to divide his fans (and haters), by veering from his strategy of trying to appease a electric mix of listeners Drake has produced a focused, challenging project that one suspects will age favourably. Highlights include Falling Back, Texts Go Green, Sticky, Massive, Ties That Bind, Overdrive, Liability and Jimmy Cooks.
Another Drake's album we didn't want and didn't need. 100% commercial/shopping mall soulless pop music.
As much as I give Drake a hard time, I will admit that he is normally great at what he does....This album was not it though. It didn't seem well thought out and rushed. The best way to describe this album is wet bread...Drake doesn't have to vocal strength/skill to sing on a whole album. He needs real singers to back him up.
One of the worst album of the century.He fell off since 2015, better retire or spent more years to make albums.
I really was hoping I would enjoy this, but in my honest opinion, this is already the 2nd worst album of the decade, with Drake also claiming the number one spot with Certified Lover Boy. Drake continues to prove that he doesn't give a damn about his music anymore and proceeds to curse our ears with these abhorrent sound waves coming into our ear canals, vibrating our eardrums, producing a sound that he has the audacity to call quality music. Avoid this album at all costs
After CLB (which I thought was okay) I was hoping Drake's next album would be one of his best. Pretty disappointed by this one I can't lie. I guess he deserves credit for switching up his sound but he did not do it well in my opinion. This could've been a great album and it has its merits but everything about it is extremely underwhelming overall. I don't like the album as a whole, and the few songs that are okay are nowhere near Drake's best. Even his other albums that I would consider on the weaker side have at least one or two songs I really like that bring me back to it, but I can't say the same about this album. I hope his next is better.
There is no good song other that a little in this drake album. no good. no good.
Um Esforço e um respeito as fãs sempre tentando trazer novidades e não indo ao óbvio, Mesmo com a carreira consagrada são poucos que se atrevem
Genuinely a project that grows on you. Although I loved it from the beginning, the more I listened to it the better it was. I also had a lot of peopleThat agreed with this. If you listen to it without expecting a hip-hop album, I think it gives you a better ear for it. A beautiful curve ball.
The melodies keep on playing on my head… can’t get enough of it.. album of the year for me
Somehow throughout the way, sadly, we lost Drake. Not even a decent effort, Drake continuous to disappoint his most loyal fan base.
The GOAT returns with a left-field classic. Gets better with every listen. Polarizing but will eventually get its credit like 808s.
Don't ever surprise me with your garbage albums drake, this is one of the worst albums in 2022
if u don’t understand the album, it wasn’t made for you, so damn good and well done
A really different album from Drake here, but I do believe this is good… tracks to listen out for are “falling back”, “texts go green”, “massive” and “flights booked”
album of the year + drake is a GOAT. falling back will win song of the year for sure
Some of most underwhelming music he’s ever released, different type of style with this one, might not resonate with most, but might grow to enjoy some tracks
People keep comparing the reaction to 808s but it’s not that. AT ALL. 808s was genre shifting. This is just regular dance/house. It’s pretty bad dance music at that. Some songs just drag on and on. When you start vining to something, Drake comes in and says something stupid. Nothing on here for anyone that isn’t a Drake stan.
A strange album. The album is all over the place, there are quite a few different genres in it, but none done particularly well. I like Jimmy Crooks that song will be popular, its a classic Drake song. Some nice production on here with cool electronic sounds, but some bad production too. I think the autotune on the album is too much. Which is an odd choice because drake can sing, and has sounded better on previous records.But honestly, loads of 2 min songs that are just so meh like Calling My Name,Currents,A Keeper. One whole minute of the song is just the same line repeated. Then there's like a house song. His singing is really not great. Its just not very good, quite uninspiring, and allover the place.
Is there an artist who is less outgoing with his sound than drake? Another attempt to tap the well of Caribbean sound as seen in more life is an unmotivated and boring go of it. Nothing sticks out here really, and this album is destined to be forgotten, and it should be. I will say it, drake has gotten complacent. Nothing he has made in 5 years is even remotely interesting, he works better when he has a chip on his shoulder.
As both a EDM and hip hop fan, this **** is the WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR. Only decent / good song was Jimmy Cooks, which 21 carried. WTF are these lyrics??? YOUR **** CALLING MY NAME???? WTF. When **** see Aubrey Graham they **** turn into the **** SAHARA NOT THE OCEAN. WTFFFFFF.
It lived up to everything I expected from an experimental Dance/House Album
Drake decided to wake up and give the gays everything they want. The first half of the album is pretty mid and 'Sticky' is probably the worst song I've ever listened to, but from 'Massive' onwards, it is a PERFECT album.
Praticamente um álbum solo, não se escorou em ninguém então um 8 pela coragem
Drake's 'Honestly, Nevermind' album comes only about six months after his release of 'Certified Lover Boy'... and the fact that it comes out only six months after that very much shows on this album. Throughout the album, Drake's vocals sound like they were recorded and slapped on the song raw through Apple's "Voice Memos" app, and "Falling Back" sounding like it was mixed through a pair of dollar tree earbuds. Speaking of production, whoever decided it was a good idea to put a looping sound of bed springs on the track "Currents" should be fired immediately.Lyrically and vocally, it's fairly similar to 'Certified Lover Boy'. It's boring, sleepy, and bland, but something a little bit newer: repetitive. Who knows why Drake thought it would be a good idea on some of the tracks to repeat the same hook over and over again... maybe he's forgot how to write a song? Let's get this clear: it's usually verse — chorus — verse — chorus —bridge — chorus — outro. Perhaps this is Drake's attempt to be quirky and different? But, to me, the only thing it accomplished is making the album an all around drag to listen to.The best song on this album is in fact the 'Intro' track, it's mesmerizing, luscious, and ambient. However, after that track, it's just all downhill, with one last attempt of revival at the end with a somewhat listenable song with 21 Savage. I feel like Drake has lost his touch and passion for music and is just releasing music to get streams. He should take as much time as possible to really work on an album with an increased attention to detail instead of taking six months to make a horrific attempt at making a house music inspired album that belongs in the speakers of an ice skating rink, only to be subconsciously listened to.
A different sound than your typical Drake project. I feel that it could be better in a lot of ways, but is a nice listen once you’ve got the gist of it.
Drake's most different album so far. Nobody imagined that he would release an all-dance album. I loved that he stepped out of his comfort zone and delivered excellent productions.
El MIDAS del pop anglosajon. Este tipo nació para esto entiendanlo yaaaa. Honestly prefiero el Drizzy versátil, incursionado en géneros nuevos, claramente es un álbum muy comercial lo reconozco. But afrobeat, danceHall, rap, pop, UK drill, reguetón, r&b and ..., con el respeto de todos Drake y Bad Bunny son el Google, el motor de arranque de música a nivel global . Mi humilde opinión team DRIZZY. Hater HONESTLY, NEVERMIND...
It’s a House music album I enjoyed it, thought it was different from the last albums.
People expected a rap album but it's not bad for a dance album. Very cohesive project and he stuck with one sound. It's more like a playlist imo for whenever you're in a late night dancy mood.
This new album by Drake is refreshing, the use of R&B and pop in this album show off how he has used these elements to his advantage. The production value on this album in some tracks feels stronger than some on CLB. However, this album can be improved upon, as some parts in this album are weaker and need more. Therefore, I will be giving this album a 7/10.
This is gonna be a underrated drake album I can already tell it cause it's reviews aren't good. It's a good recovery from clb
bro... i honestly expected more, i was disappointed... sorry drake, I did not like
I didn't know what to expect from the album. But i was quite surprised to hear a house album. But soon i realised that every track sounded the same. Except for the last one they all sound like "Get it together" from "More Life". The Album is really boring and i'm not quite sure if CLB or this one was worse. The title sums up the album quite well. "Honestly, Nevermind"
Mid, Only 2 listenable songs, all the other ones are mid. If this is the direction Drake is going, its not good.
Honestly, he could have kept this one. Actually I have never understood the hype on Drake, I think he is too overrated. The album is full of basic beats and lyrics, and (as always) there aren't almost any rhymes. Very disappointing.
its really a 6.5 but ratio yall cant calll it a 4.5 goofy ahh kids scary hours 3 is dropping so pipe down
Honestly, Nevermind was actually not a bad album sure it not better then drake's other ablums but way better then Certified Lover Boy one of Drake's worst ablum he ever produced, the music in the ablum is actually not that bad and the songs are really pretty cool to listen but it is the best ablum of 2022, no kendrick lamar and the weeknd made better ablum then what drake is doing i mean sure drake will never come back to it golden age of his carrer but still this is not a bad ablum from the rapper in general.
After a few listens this album started to grow on me. It certainly isn’t a “dance” album at all, it’s more of an emotional slow ride that shines in that regard. People hated on Drake for CLB for not trying something new, yet he does so in this album and people hate it because of the fact it’s different. I don’t believe his intention was to make a massive breakthrough, but rather follow up on his previous album with a different stance. This is a solid, emotional and rhythmic listen; one that I truly enjoy.
My biggest problem with Drake over the course of his career has been his unwillingness to evolve or experiment. The last time he really stepped out of his comfort zone (before this record) was on IYRITL, which is far and away my favorite drake project, and ever since that record I've been waiting for him to step into similarly uncharted territory on a studio album. So when this album dropped by surprise and I heard from people that it was wildly different that what he was doing on CLB I was actually pretty excited. I could have not been more wrong. This album is awful, absolutely terrible. There are numerous Drake projects I dislike, in fact his last three or four studio albums I've found to be pretty lackluster overall, but this is the first album of his that I would consider to be an absolute disaster. I have no problem with Drake playing with different sounds, be it house music or anything else, but to do it so lazily and soullessly just boggles my mind. I can't recommend this to anyone, unless you think you'd enjoy the musical equivalent of waiting in line at the dmv
I Love Me Some Drake And All Types Of Music From Around The World. But This Album Is So Bad..That I Can't Even Stand To Finish It! Meaning Listen To The Rest! 78 Per Cent Of His Trolls Are Liking His Garbage! I'm Like.. My God..It's Awful! I CANT! Smh Lol
This **** is trash. Drake’s worst laziest piece of work yet. First time in his career he pretends to take a risk and does it in the most uninspired way possible. Man’s should take a long break after this one
Amazing songs on a different vibe by an amazing artist ! The goat is versatile.
Drake is the AJR of RnB and Hip Hop music.A culture vulture who is able to phone it in on every idea he attempts and still gets praised for it.
Not always hitting where it should but ultimately refreshing and a welcome change to his musical palette
On the album "Honestly, Nevermind", I respect Drake's continued willingness to experiment and try new genres and sounds. Many consider versatility and experimentation to be important in the progression of an artist, and you can see it on display in this project. As people have pointed out, this album is not a groundbreaking addition to the House genre, but people should not be looking at it through that lens. Drake is not a House artist, he is mainly a Hip-hop artist, and that is his bread and butter. People should appreciate Drake's willingness to step out of his comfort zone, and the fact that he's using his platform to advance this kind of music. I rate this album a 7/10 since I like the experimentation, although it may not be the best.
Not as bad as people make it out to be. People who claim this is bad house never listened to house. A criticism that is often thrown around is that it's repetitive; you could as well just write "I don't understand house" on your forehead. It's not just house of course, as it's mixed a lot with dancehall, something Drake has been attempting a lot lately, but never this succesfully. Drake is one of the few artists whose upbeat rap tracks are as enjoyable as his R&B ballads, and I was honestly waiting for a ballad-only album from him, and this comes close. He jazzily twirls around the mellow dance tracks talking about his unconventional practices in relationships: tongue-in-cheekly alluding to polygamy on the video clip of the opening track; breaking hearts with even more cruelty than his rap colleagues, because he does seem to care about these women. The second half of the album (after Massive) shows a sharp decline in quality, but it picks itself up from time to time - mostly on Liability, which sounds like a slowed reverb Drake track, almost psychedelic, and showing he still got it with the on-the-verge-of-cringe lines: "You put your words together like you getting points for that **** like you playing scrabble on me", immediately followed by the shattering: "Your mama's the sweetest lady, the apple fell far from the tree". All in all, the people who claim this is trash are farther from the truth than the people who praise this to the heavens, but once again the internet is divided about something that is "just okay" (which cannot exist on the internet of course).
Just like the last album it's mainly filler, but there are a few good tracks you will be listening to on repeat. If you don't understand how Drake works by now you probably never will. This is what he does: mediocre albums with radio banging singles.
A disappointing improvement from tge soulless "certified lover boy". This surprise release feels as rushed as its announcement but it also goes on to show the deake who made albums you could respect is gone. The intro is inw of the vest moments on a drake record in a long time but "dalling on me" deadpan repetition tests that goodwill. "Text go green " is almost something great as you're lured by the mesmerizing pulsating and skittering club beats but it's just the lyrical and vocal performance that consistently falls short though i will acknowledge this song has actually effort behind it. It's actually trying to be profound and introspective. "Currents" decides notvto continue what the previous track almist achieved and withdraws to predictable Drake-isms that ask for a vulnerability he would never reciprocate from a women hes showing temporary interest in. The production here still isnt awful but wasted on this era of drake. Overall this house influenced Dawn Fm offshoot is a step up from the overwhelming decadence of his previous lp post "Scorpion " where record's would be 20+ songs long with no variety here it's short but with more experiments(technically) . If this grew over time I'd understand.
This album is sooo cringe. If this were created by anyone else, it would be ripped apart. Proof that Drake can take a crap in a trash bag and it will sell like a hotcake during a food shortage. Hilariously praised that it's goat material by the sheeple. Ladies and gentlemen, he is trolling us. This joke is on us.
Neither meat nor fish. Perhaps the pandemic has led artists to experiment too much...daring is fine, but Drake is to house like David Guetta is to country music
What a bad album. Rushed and uninspired. Sounds cheap. Beyoncé about to show him how REAL house music is made.
So happy Drake finally switched up his formula from the repetitive template of Views. Love when an artist explores new sounds. Execution could have been better, but there are some solid tracks and this is no where near as bad as internet memes would lead you to believe imo.I believe a lot of the pushback is a result of a perceived macho masculine artist making music typically associated with the queer community (house) and singing his heart out (though vocals could be better).
Okay, I'm a little dizzy. Drake is hard to describe at this point; some say it is redundant. Others go further and manage to praise his creativity. I think there are several moments that are repeated, but the situation has changed when listening to the rapper making house music. Do you know how common it is to see this these days? Now, don't say that you only think of Kaytranada when you listen to this record, because there are more than on black artist doing this genre. In short, this album is curiously unique, and I mean that in a good way.fav tracks: "A Keeper", "Flight's Booked", "Calling My Name", "Sticky" & "Falling Back"KEY-TRACK: "Massive"
it wasnt good it only had two good songs the vibe was not good and hes able to do way better
Probably drake’s most mid album, the minamal dance beats are interesting at first but get boring as the album progresses. Not awful, but nothing special.
This is just a terrible album start to finish. I don’t revisit a single track from this song. Not even Jimmy Cooks because it’s just a lazily done version of Knife Talk. **** this album.
admirable[ ad-mer-uh-buhl ]adjectiveworthy of admiration; inspiring approval, reverence, or affection.
this album is just another hit to drakes legacy and career it is a messy cheap sounding dusty album the album sounds so outdated and the sampling either drags the tracks down or actually is the only good part of the song the album has 2 good tracks and 1 which has replayability which is jimmy cooks and mostly for 21 Savage
You would think after how atrocious Certified Lover Boy was, Drake could only go higher. Unfortunately, it's not the case here with his 7th studio album, Honestly, Nevermind, a title rightfully chosen.It's how uninspired and ridiculously blend the record is that makes it especially bad: it's trying to serve Dawn FM but doesn't reach an ounce of its artistry, it sadly ends up serving Donda 2's unfinished and unpolished aftertaste and it's finally caring way less soul and effort than bigger (and better) album-sister, More Life. On his new worst song in his career, "Currents", Drake showcase possibly the most horrible production from any hip-hop/dancehall record in recent years, would even go as far as the entirety of music's history. Is it his famous collaborator Noah "40"'s fault? Maybe... or it's Drake new fall from grace. The rest of the album? Absolutely embarrassing.Us to Drake: Honestly, Nevermind!
rating it this low to help win arguements on twitter. not a good album either way tho
Listening to this album was a complete surprise. It sounded nothing like what I expected, the typical rap album from Drake. It's great to see artists experiment, and in this case, not make another rap album in which most of the songs sound the same, now what we have is a dance album in which most of the songs sound the same. I am going to be honest, I enjoyed listening to this album, I may have even danced a little bit, but that doesn't change the fact that this album feels repetitive and basic, and not even the collaboration with 21 savage could save this album. Drake should've spent more time with this record, to try and make it a little more... listenable.
I am a massive Drake fan so when i heard he was dropping a new album i really hoped it was better than his previous Album "Certified Lover Boy" which came out last year and imo it was a lot better than CLB but Overall i did not really enjoy the more dance, R&B style Drake was trying to go for on here and if im being honest there were only 4 songs i really enjoyed and keep replaying a lot those 4 are: Jimmy Cooks which featured the feature killer himself, the man who has never spit a Featured verse i never hated in the past 2 Years, that man being 21 Savage who btw im hoping does drop his 3rd Solo Album this year cause i really loved his last Album but Anyway Jimmy Cooks was a amazing closer to the album i really wished we got more trackd like that and Sticky which was another one of the best tracks on the album it was also released as a single later on and i appreciate that. Down Hill was another track that i really loved on here and serious if Drake had dropped a 3 Track EP with "Down Hill", "Jimmy Cooks" and "Sticky" it was most likely would have sold a lot better than this Album i guaranteed that. So Anyway Overall this Album was a Massive L in Drake's Discography and also the 3rd Straight Album in a row that Drake has dropped and it has been absolutel **** so yeah Overall Strong 3 out of 10. I hated a majority of the tracks except for "Down Hill", "Calling My Name", "Jimmy Cooks"(featuring. 21 Savage) and "Sticky".
I couldn't find a single song I liked and I love RNB and trying out new music from my favorite artist.
I'm almost in disbelief at how bad this album is. His attempt on making House music might actually be the worst in history... and it also seems like some of the songs just weren't mastered properly. Overdrive is the only decent song on this, and Jimmy Crooks is ok i guess.
It seems that Drake is trying to go easy these days. Honestly, Nevermind is likely to remain as another disappointing album after CLB. The beat that combines R&B and house deserves to be appreciated, but with its loose and unfinished sound overall seems to make this even more underestimated. I loved the track Jimmy Crooks (feat. 21 Savage) and A Keeper.
Essa monete é muito superestimada, manas. Ninguém aguenta mais além dos robôs que vivem flodando stream.
Drake’s newest album combines rich, modern instrumentals with some of the greatest vocal performances of his career.
A very, very, very, very, very "ok" album, isn't bad, but it isn't good. At least there's a nice vibe, but nothing special at all.
Flight's booked sounds outstanding for the first round, very simialr to last couples of albums
Drake going on deep house territory, but can he still rap ? For a surprise album, that was a huge surprise. Great album for clubbing, but that's pretty much it. I would've expected more from him, in a year where Pusha T and Kendrick dropped.
I had much hope that the Drizzy we all loved and came to appreciate had returned with the intro tracks, Intro followed into Falling Back. With the polarizing production and groove that you wouldn't expect out of drake. At first listen you say after the first couple tracks, "this production is great, I wonder what else he has in store for us?" He didn't have anything else in store. The whole album is another heartbreak or lust filled song that has been so dried out from previous albums/songs of the same topic. It's just Drake's creative way of making the SAME **** I appreciate the experimental aspect of the album. However grooving 808s, drums, and samples just slightly tweaked on every club bass sample isn't creative. With dry and over tuned vocals from Mr. Lover Boy himself make for a boring listen. I actually skipped through most songs in the later portion of the album due to them not being different. At first you wanna dance, then you get bored, and then you get excruciatingly bored. You could tell someone to listen to one song on this album and it would be a preview of 90% of the album.Although tracks like Jimmy Cooks and Sticky change the tempo in a positive manner it goes right back to the same boring Drizzy.An honest disappointment of an album. Sounding just as rushed as the release, it's going to fall short in Drake's album discography.
A surprise album from Drake I’m sure was a delight for many, but dread immediately set in for me knowing darn well that if this album was anything like “Certified Lover Boy” we were doomed to a summer of Drake Stan’s claiming that this album was “as good as Mr. Morale” or some nonsense like that. You’ll certainly be hearing this album all summer, but rest assured, my fears were quickly realized. While I won’t say this album is as bad as “CLB” it’s not good in any right. The house sound is cool on some tracks (Sticky, Massive), but overall the sound seems as confused as Drake has seemed to be these past few years. Almost every song on the album is at least a minute or more too long as Drake “oohhs and ahhhs” or repeats the same line for the majority of tracks. I admire Drake for trying something new with this house direction and if nothing else he’s produced some easy to listen to music about his general subject matter, but got someone who is allegedly one of the greats, that’s simply not enough. “Jimmy Cooks” to the surprise of no one is far and away the best track on this project and it’s truthfully not even close. 21 and Drake have great chemistry on the track and I would’ve rather us got 14 tracks like this then the confused house mess we ended up with. Unless something drastically changes it seems nothing will ever change in Drake’s subject matter and therefore his ceiling can only be so high for me. The repetition of this album was unbelievable and I didn’t think Drake could achieve a higher level of repeatability, I was wrong. Don’t get it twisted, however, these tracks will still be played all summer simply because it’s Drake. Overall, I give this project a very generous 50/100. Between the effort to try something new and the standout track “Jimmy Cooks” I felt the album was still a much better try at producing music than “CLB”.Best Track: “Jimmy Cooks”Worst Track: “Texts Go Green” “Liability”Overall Score: 50/100
drake is just tired. let him go home and sleep. "be" for five minutes. joe and the juice album. get outa of here certified boy lovers. this **** sucks Stalin's ass.
Man this was horrible. Drake clearly doesnt try anymore, this album is lazy and a rip off of the entire house genre. 2015 was the last time he dropped a good project and then he discovered that he needs no effort to gain commercial success, so he acts like he still trying to experiment styles but really he just puts what ever he knows his corny fanbase will enjoy and it sucks every time
Drake made this album with Garageband. This all sound unpolished with poor lyrics.
I really liked the vibe of the album. he fix the mistakes that he did in clb to give us this great album i think this is the best album in 2022
Honestly mid, never in my life have I ever heard something such mid, if I were drake I would honestly retire, the music makes me want to end it all
Honestamente que album sem carisma nenhum, foi feito sem paixão alguma, Drake novamente quer tentar fazer hits gostosos como "One Dance" e "Passionfruit", porém falha miseravelmente.
When I see some publications give this 7/10 and above, I know they couldn't have listened to the album. I don't care what genre this album is pretending to be, this somehow finds a way to be even lazier and less thought out than CLB. The production is terrible and nothing on this is inspiring.
Imagina você um rapper consagrado lançar um disco de Dance, a versatilidade desse artista não existe nessa indústria a anos, um belo trabalho feito com carinho para os fãs, e não se acomodando nessa onda trap da mesma batida
Just a bad, bad, lazy album. I really cannot say how poorly executed the idea of a house album this presents.
**** savage carries **** drake he's washed Youngboy Better Lain Better **** Canada
I could not get through this album without my ears wanting to throw up. I haven’t felt that with an album for a while. Easily forgettable
Honestly, nevermind listening to most of these songs ever again. Only few saviors of this album are Currents and Jimmy Cooks (because 21 carried). 21 sounded great on that track and made it enjoyable towards the ladder half. Most of the tracks don’t have much to offer. Repeated words with horribly mixed auto tune, flows with no direction, really high pitches that just don’t fit Drakes vocal range. I thought the time he stole Look At Me from x would be his worst moment, or the Pusha T beef, this might top it. By far his most boring project.
Drake outdoes himself yet again by releasing an even worse album than his last. This is quite literally the worst album released in 2022 so far.
I MEAN, IT'S WAY BETTER THAN CLB AND SCORPION.There are a few down points like the opening track and the last songs on the record, but overall it's a pretty solid new sound for Drake and I'm here for it. IT'S SO MUCH BETTER THAN CLB
o álbum trás melodias relaxantes e perfeitas, sem dúvidas um projeto muito bom! Drake representou perfeitamente o dance apesar de ser um artista de hip hop além de trazer bastante criatividade para as músicas, com transições bem colocadas e perfeitamente encaixadas. Só achei q a última música c o feat do 21 savage não deveria fazer parte do album por se diferenciar claramente do tema e estilo geral do EP, entretanto é uma ótima faixa!
I'll have to hear the album again before I have a clear feeling of if i like this or not. Most songs I heard featured Drake's singing, so that might have pushed this to a 6 instead of a standard 7. However, i like how most songs aren't explicit in any shape or form, which is certainly a departure for this Canadian rapper. I love the beats; this is my kind of music i like from male singers.
Drake returns with a surprise record in terms of release, But pretty unsurprising in terms of substance. Filled with lifeless and drab rythymic loops, and Dance Pop rythyms, that often repeat themselves to eternity, The production, despite being a switchup (I guess you could call that) is just incredibly unremarkable and boring. Lacking any kind of flavour or taste in the execution of the already generic ideas, The production only makes the fascinatingly lazy songwriting and performances stand out even more. When I saw that this was a new ground for him, I was happy thinking that he atleast gets that he needs a sonic switchup to make something substantial. Little did I know that he will use this as an excuse to be more lazy in his works.
The only good thing about this album is the final track Jimmy Cooks and that’s because its in a completely different style to the rest of the album!
This album just feels like another Certified Lover Boy, except in Dance form. Jimmy Cooks is definitely my favorite song, and basically the only song I play from this album. Every other song is ok
What in the elevator music, tryna recreate passionfruit, typa album is this.
"hej!" é uma miscelânea de faixas, aparentemente produzidas sem pensar em como todas elas soariam em sequência. Falta alguma consciência, solidez e coesão ao álbum, o que é uma pena, porque há boas ideias nesta produção do produtor londrino.
Born In The Echoes is another example of Rowlands and Simons' magic way of making machines sing. A+Born In the Echoes is better than Random Access Memories (Daft Punk 2013)It deserves a Grammy :)
I'm a bit torn on this one... it's quite a treat in places, but I can't help but feel the album lacks ambition, cohesion and 'punch' overall. For every masterful track ('Taste Of Honey', 'Under Neon Lights', 'Born in the Echoes'), there's an anonymous one ('Sometimes I Feel So Deserted', 'Wide Open', 'Reflexion'). Tracks like 'I'll See You There' and 'Go' are somwhat "vintage Chemical Brothers" in their style, but it's been done before to better effect on their previous outings (the psychedelic hooks and arrangements of 'Setting Sun' and 'Let Forever Be' just blow 'I'll See You There' out of the water, as does 'Just Get Yourself High' and 'Galvanize' VS. 'Go').I also fail to sense the overall artistic direction of the album. Maybe it's the tracklist and transitions between tracks that's off, but the experimental tracks of the second half just don't 'fit' that well with the restrained dance tracks of the first. It may be intentional; but I always found that one of the Chemical Brothers' greatest strengths back in the day was their ability to merge a plethora of different musical influences into a cohesive, artistic whole. Whether you're listening to 'Let Forever Be' or 'Hey Boy, Hey Girl' you just KNOW it's the Chemical Brothers. Not so here, I'm afraid.I think part of the problem is that they've stripped their sound a bit to make it more minimalist in style - this can be a strength (the title track 'Born in the Echoes' is fantastic), but for the most part I just feel like it's robbed the Brothers' of their personality - the psychedelic edge and zaniness that made their early albums come together, come alive and explode. Seriously, check out the acid-induced production on 'Dig Your Own Hole' or 'Surrender'... it's so trashy, insane and original, you'll feel like you've gone to space and back when it's over!Just to be clear, while I'd love for them to embrace the experimental APPROACH to production of their earlier works a bit more, I'm NOT saying that they should just go 'back to their roots' and repeat the same kind of compositions over and over again... the best tracks on Born in the Echoes are the ones where they try something new and experimental (Taste Of Honey, Born in the Echoes, Under Neon Lights are AWESOME tracks). More of that, please! I'm actually one of the few who liked their colab. with Miguel on 'This is Not A Game', a fresh, weirdly unpolished psychedelic take on a pop-track - and I'm actually not that down on 'We Are the Night' which, while certainly not perfect, had a bit more personality than a lot of the tracks on here. I'm just saying that they shouldn't be afraid to be a bit more ambitious in their productions - experiment, go crazy! It's what made us fall in love with them in the first place. Besides, they've already established themselves as the godfathers of their genre - with no need to prove anything to anyone, why not just go mental and try something completely different?Here's hoping that their next album will be the masterpiece that I'm dead certain they still have in them... "The future - I'll see you there!" ;)
I love this record. It feels smarter and more restrained than previous Chemical Brothers albums. Sort of like they stopped trying so hard with technical the gimmicks and wizardry, and gave way to a more confident, minimal sound.
I've been a big fan of the chemical brother for a long time and i was just waiting for them to come out with a new cd. This one has a lot of catchy tracks. I don't know if they'll ever reach the same level of catchiness as block rocking beats or setting sun, but this one has some memorable tunes. Definitely worth downloading.
A szintetikus méz íze(The Chemical Brothers: Born In The Echoes albumkritika)A The Chemical Brothers egy 1991-ben alapított veterán elektronikus zenei duó, akik pályafutásuk csúcsán leginkább a big beat műfajában jeleskedtek. A formáció zenetörténeti szempontból is jelentős érdeme, hogy az élőben kevert elektronika segítségével olyan bombasztikus hangzást hoztak létre, amelynek hatása a nyolcvanas évek stadionrockjáéhoz hasonlítható. Azonban 2015-ben már abszolút megkérdőjelezhető a relevanciájuk. Képes Tom Rowlands és Ed Simons bármekkora visszhangot kelteni napjaink könnyűzenei légterében?A Sometimes I Feel So Deserted tökéletes nyitány. Felkelti, és zseniális módon fokozza az érdeklődést, valamint előkészíti a terepet a kirobbanó refrénű Go-nak. Ehhez a menetelős dalhoz egyébként a legendás francia rendező, Michel Gondry rendezett látványos videoklipet. Hét szürke ruhás hölggyel, akik nagyon egyszerre mozognak, s kezükben két rúddal bizarr módon jelenítik meg a zene lüktetésének minden apró finomságát. Az ezután következő Under Neon Lights-ban St. Vincent vendégszerepel. Őt sokan a huszonegyedik század női David Bowie-jaként aposztrofálják. A felvételből sugárzik a visszafojtott feszültség. A Kémiai Fivérek az EML Rituallal folytatják, amit olyan hallgatni, mintha egy alumíniumkohó működne a fejünkben. Az itt kissé megfeneklett albumnak új lendületet és frissességet kölcsönöz az élő dobszerkó hatásával megtámogatott I’ll See You There. Első hallgatásra mondjuk nehéz megállapítani, hogy nem a konyhában, hanem a jövőben fogják látni az illetőt, akihez a nóta szól. A Just Bang egy végigpartizott fesztiváli éjszaka hangulatára emlékeztet, a Reflexion pedig a lehető legjobb értelemben véve veretős. Nem úgy, mint egy David Guetta vagy Fatboy Slim szett… A bugyborékolós Taste Of Honey egész érdekes hallgatnivaló, bár a Lenny Welch és a The Beatles által is fémjelezett azonos című klasszikus után azért kellemesebb az ember szájíze. A mézaromás szerzemény egybeolvad a lemez címadójával, a zakatolós Born In The Echoes-zal. Ennek a fogyasztása leginkább azoknak ajánlott, akik át szeretnék élni, hogy milyen beszorulni egy telefonfülkébe, megfelelő mennyiségű aprópénz hiányában. Ezt követi a lemez instrumentális csúcspontja, a Radiate. Kellemes lelkiállapot és felszabadultság költözik szívünkbe ennek hallatán. A záróakkord a Born In The Ehoes legmenőbb hangzású trackje, a Beck énekével erősítő, slágeres Wide Open. Ez annak is tetszhet, akinek egyébként borsódzik a háta ettől az egész Chemical Brothers dologtól.A deluxe verzió négy további dallal kecsegtet. A hangulatos Let Us Build A City és a teljesen korrekt Wo Ha után megbizonyosodhatunk arról, hogy a Go és a Reflexion extended mixben is van olyan ütős, mint rövidebb változatuk.A Born In The Echoes az ilyesfajta elektronikus zene rajongóinak kötelező darab. A kevésbé szakavatottabb füleknek ellenben azt javaslom, hogy bánjanak óvatosan az anyaggal. A kissé avítt megoldások, és a csak majdnem egységesen magas színvonal könnyen elveheti bárki kedvét ettől a fantasztikus párostól. Az audiovizuális szülőcsatorna viszont mindenképpen meghozta a kívánt eredményt: újjászülettek a visszhangokban.7/10
I don't usually enjoy electronic albums but damn if they were all like this it would probably be one of my favourite genres. The Chemical Brothers are so good at building up each track and creating catchy beats. Also, they really make use of the few features on the record; the St.Vincent and Beck features are really interesting and it actually feels like they worked hard with the band to create their tracks. Nice to see Q-Tip on a CB song again as well. So Yh 7/10 that might not sound like much but as I said before I'm not a massive fan of electronic music. This is actually my favourite record of the year so far in that genre.
This album is complete and utter garbage. The tracks are unoriginal, and the overall writing is pathetic. Anybody who's coming out and saying this deserves a Grammy is an absolute moron. If you want real electronic music, I strongly suggest that you listen to Random Access Memories by Daft Punk. Don't put poison in your ears with this crap, it's one of the worst electronic albums I've heard in a long time.
I tried to listen to the album twice in order to give it a fair rating, but both times I quit after the first 4 tracks and the silence afterwards is so comforting. So in my opinion this work is nothing but annoying. I can't imagine a single event or occasion to listen to this.
6.5 z
A good overall record, but missing out on the epic landmark moments like The Test, Where Do I Begin or even the obvious bang-on-moments like Hey Boy, Hey Girl or Galvanize or Block Rockin' Beats. It's a good solid mix of (a little too much) tried and true chemical synth abuse, but a little bit lacking in the beat department. As much as the songwriting and tweaking skills have developed, the drums kind of take a back seat in recent ChemBros records. They'r organic and raw and analog, but they don't punch like they used to. Overall, this album is solidly good, but no DYOH pt.2 or another sort of great re-imagination of their sound.
Another wicked electronic album that could be played in entire at a late night club, dancing with all your friends, letting go. Very creative music and great guest appearances by St. Vincent, Beck and Q-Tip. What could be better?!
--press play--1. Sometimes I feel so Deserted: Good intro, good groove. I start to feel I will like this album. It certainly does not sound like the previous Further (2010), which I loved, but is not bad at all.2. Go: What could go wrong? One of the singles, old style ChemBros. all the way, both music and video. I got the feeling this could be one of their best albums. I wonder who "Q-tip" is...3. Under Neon Lights: Not bad, not as good as the two previous songs. Not a fan of how she sings.4. EML Ritual: Don't like where this is going. Annoying ship noises, idiotic repetition of the 'chorus'.5. I'll See You There: "let forever be"-style beats. 303-ish synths. Not my tempo.6. Just Bang: Ok, this starts to sound more and more like old, very old Bros. But not the good ones, like the not-so-good tracks of the first albums.7. Reflexion: Average. However, I am sure they have used the exact same sounds (and loops) on another song (can't remember which one).8. Taste of Honey: The Bros. have never been famous for their lyric quality, but "If you don't have no money, You won't get no honey, It just keeps on growin', The money is flowin'" COME ON!! Very, very bad.--already want to play stop, but continue...--9. Born in the Echoes: Another mediocre song, not good enough to give the name to the album.10. Radiate: A robot voice slowly saying Ra-di-ate! Not the best tribute to Kraftwerk.11. Wide Open: Think of a closing song similar to "the pills won't help you now", but not nearly as good.--finished--Conclusion: Is not a bad album, but I did not enjoy it as much as I was expecting. It may be because I like so much the direction they went with Further (2010) and they definitely did not follow on this one.
What should a dance album really be? A reminiscence of countless raves from the past? A subtle variety in beats? Hud Mo gives a pretty explicit answer: it should be fun. With endless want of "originality" and "uniqueness" in contemporary music industry most EDM producers focused all of their attention on creating a sound of their own, their trademark. Although the idea by itself isn't that harmful it did bring many problems to the table. People became obsessed with the idea of creating something completely new, which leads us to the present moment, where we already lack decent dance record producers, since there's almost nobody actually looking forward to creating a likable record, but creating a "unique concept" seems like their central idea. Sometimes this notion even leads to the creation of a pseudo-nostalgic album that borrows that originality from the long-gone and very adored culture, that doesn't do much but destroy the appreciation for the genre (I'm not calling names, but everybody knows who I'm talking about).And here we have Hudson Mohawke with his little sister humbly and softly pronouncing his stage name at the beginning of the record. An ironic little gesture to oh-so-many DJ's who just love to put their names in their record, screaming them, until you go completely paranoid. But this is different... This is much more personal, sincere, almost like that little whisper in the wind that attracts your attention to something much greater. And it does. The Pan Sonic-ish noise completely surrounds you the next second. But it's almost harmonic, gently guiding you even further, to your first breath. We should all say thank you to Hudson to at least be one of the few EDM producers to actually try to create a conceptual album. It's spiritually, emotionally connected. The album just screams for a genuine little smile, almost a smirk on your face, for you body to smoothly move, following the flow of soul-driven tracks.There's so much more to mention about this album, but what I feel many miss in regards to understanding the album, is freedom to move. It IS a dance record after all. Try to shake off the strict attitude of a musical snob and just enjoy the way your body reacts to the almost-perfect production. After all, it cannot be denied. This album does make you want to dance, fully fulfilling its role.
This is the first time I listen to one of Hudson Mohawke's albums. I was appalled by this guy's versatility. Even if it rarely leaves the electro side, its music remains highly refreshing, intense, unexpected and pure in one of the weirdest ways. He surprisingly manages to fuse both accessible 'mainstream' pop and experimental electro. The progressiveness of each and every track is a sign of true originality and transpires from his desire to constantly renew his music approach. Obviously some of his moves appear to be failed or less rewarding than the rest, as 'Lil Djembe' or 'System'... but I guess the most important is to remember that he tried. However 'Lantern' remains a notable HudMo album paved with a gigantic amount of a rough and touching energy. 'Lantern' can roar as it can observe a resourceful and religious silence.
One of the best comeback albums an artist could make. Veteran Grace fans will instantly recognize it's her and her style upon first listen. Nearly 23 years after "Bulletproof Heart", Grace Jones still has that magic.
'Hurricane' is a biggest comeback by a veteran artist! Grace Jones's imagination it so dark and powerful that made me feel like I was inside the hell and on the same time on heaven. This is amazing!!!
This is the gem in her catalog for sure, a beautifully crafted masterpiece. The so-called music critics who have given the album only favorable reviews are truly clueless. They all can go back to kissing up to generic bands like u2 and britney spears.
A great album by a great performer and artist. Released 19 years after her 1989 album "Bulletproof Heart", Grace returns to form, mixing her new-wave artistry, now influenced by her Jamaican heritage. The results are quite strong. Listen to: Hurricane, Corporate Cannibal, This Is, Williams' Blood.
this could be one of her very best comeback, its weirdness makes this album look like a kind of spectacular time-bomb, that's the way creativity goes.
A tedious minimal-electro-pop record delivered by this Sacramento Ca. band, that helps as a shopping, or elevator background music. It just causes the boring reaction, because of its way, using almost the same regular tempo while trying to make a tribute to the disco, electro & funk records. Beware of the singer who tries to be "sexy" and stylish, 7 people on his band and no one stoped him? A perfect gift for your friend the clothes store clerk... a burned copy of course.
Much more assured of what they are, !!! bring us the best pop action in ages. By the corrosive dance rock of "The Hammer" to the lo-fi rap of "Hollow", Strange Weather, IsnÂ´t it? came out on the right place at the right time.
For a band that seemed to be on the verge of collapse after two untimely deaths and some departing members, !!! are more focused than ever on Strange Weather, Isn't It? I like the focus on solid grooves that form the basis of every track on the album. The late Jerry Fuchs provides his tight drumming talent on "The Hammer" and "The Most Certain Sure" sounds like something you'd see Dirk Diggler dancing to at Boogie Nights. It goes by rather quickly at about 40 minutes, but there isn't one weak song to be found.
I must be getting old, but I am finding most of the critics out of touch with what I find great this year. Strange Weather is tyher case in point: Is it as fresh as their earlier works? No. Is it a great pop record? Damn straight it is. Great on the stereo and the idevice, it'll make your day a happy one.
Acolyte is a good album with plenty to get excited about. Opening track of Clarion Call is energetic and with the album featuring fan favourites such as Counterpoint and Doubt; They wont be disappointed with the album! A few other stand out tracks are Halcyon and Submission. Acolyte may not grab you on your first listen but after a few times you will enjoy. A solid debut album.
Room for improvement, but a modern-day Depeche Mode could be in the works here.My picks for the album are 'Clarion Call', 'Halcyon', 'Counterpoint' and 'Red Lights'.
I bought the album after hearing the singles. Looking forward to hear it, I was a tad disappointed. The songs are all pretty similar. They're all executed professionally and are at a high standard but sometimes it is just like listening to a 45 minute song.
The beat is crazy and nonsense!!!! i couldn't stand to listen to the whole CD.
Robyn is the Queen of pop. Every song talks with a different tone, a different mood. The best little piece of pop tis year. By single tracks Swedes don't do it more and more often: The Knife, The Radio Dept, The Tough Alliance, Marit Bergman, Soundtrack of Our Lives, I'm From Barcelona, Fibes, Oh Fibes, Sout It Out Louds... But many albums would be alright with less tracks. Eight is just enough to play them over and over again. I want a great dancehall version of Dancing On My Own. Please let it be on part 2.
Our pop-goddess has returned.
This first part of a proposed trilogy is another masterpiece of pop, almost as good as her last flawless effort. If the other two albums retain this level of quality, energy and freshness, we might have the pop album(s) of the year.
Robyn definitely brings the best back on "Body Talk Pt. 1" The best song ont eh album is "Dancing on My Own". The lyrics and synths are hot and the accoustic version of "Hang With Me" is the best!!!
Шведский поп действительно устанавливает высокую планку для остального мира.
"Crystal Castles II" recorre una amplia gama de ritmos que van desde los ritmos sosegados y espaciales como "Violent Dreams" o "I Am Made of Chalk", tonalidades rÃ­tmicas y bailables ( "Celestica" , "Suffocation" o "Intimate") y llega hasta los extremos donde la distorciÃ³n (Lo-fi) se remarcan y le aÃ±aden dramatismo al album ("Fainting Spells" o "Doe Deer"). Crystal Castles logra un Ã¡lbum innovador de mÃºsica electrÃ³nica con una temÃ¡tica muy oscura que puede volverse adicciÃ³n en cualquier momento.
My favourite band of 2010. It's a brilliant come back, and it's full of new material. They have become a lot more accessible, but they're finally getting some kind of mainstream success which has been long awaited. I went to see them in Manchester in October 2010, and I was blown away (mainly by the bass speakers). I'll definitely be waiting around for their third album, which hopefully won't be called 'Crystal Castles' again. They go from dance/pop hits like 'Celestica' to aggressive songs like 'Doe Deer', all in a short space of album time. It's a fantastic album. There are no "howevers" in this album, because its brilliance gets in the way too much. I would give this 11 out of 10 if I was allowed.
Crystal Castles's 2008 debut album established their sound as something most listeners either love or despise with few falling in between. This album follows up on a similar note while being more developed and richer then it's predecessor. This time around the songs feel fuller with regular use of distorted noise to back up their trademark 8 bit synth and generally stronger melodies. Tracks like Vietnam and Year of Silence continue their dance vibe while tracks like Doe Dear show they can still do quality layered noise pop. Basically if you loved their first album it's likely you'll love this one just as much if not more. On the other side though chances are if you hated their debut album this one won't win you over either.
Crystal Castles sophomore effort is far from a slump. They take what made their first album so great, and add a polished, refined sound, but still manage to have that lo-fi, edgy sonic noise that only they can make. Do I prefer this album over their first? No. Is it a good album? Absolutely. All In All, Crystal Castles have yet to make a bad album. B+
The second, also self-titled album by Crystal Castles was recorded in such places as a closed church in Iceland or a cabin in Ontario so it is natural that coldness penetrated these tracks for good. Vietnam is the best example of the new sound of the duo: a spine-chilling tale of terror with some icy synths, frigid electronic backing and unintelligible vocals. The Game Boy noises so audibly present on the previous effort are hard to find. Crystal Castles (2010) is much darker than its predecessor and it is a quite depressive affair. On every level, Alice and Ethan step forwards. Year of Silence is what you would expect from Sigur RÃ³sâ
smoke weed everyday
This album absolutely sucks compared to the first one. So horribly disappointed.
Nice album to make you easily feel good and take you out from the bad mood.
Crystal Castles est ma vie.
Unbelievable album. Even better than their first.
I must say that I'm a little bit disappointed with the new album. They are breaking new ground sonically, but the overall result isn't nearly as good as their fantastic debut. The petite bourgeois in me is annoyed and confused by all the scratching and screaming and is missing the happy 8-bit melodies of Jet Set Willy.
This album is like the upgraded version of their last work and t even keeps the same name, which I think is cool, I love almost every song and never have to skip any song when I listen to it. Love Alice so much hope they keep releasing music and already can't wait for their next work.
I love this album; i listen to this album all the time. I think this is the album of the year. This is number one on my list for best 2010 albums. I love the sound to this album, Crystal Castles is an outstanding band. One of the best Experimental band.
They have their tricks and use them well. CC decided to make a prettier album than their debut and it shows. Standout track: I'm Made of Chalk, PapaSmear, Celestica.
Using their first album (I) as a gateway drug, Ethan Kath and Alice Glass shape up the digital chaos that they create to give a more defined and matured sound. If you ask anyone who listens to CC to define what their music is, typical words and adjectives are rare to be found. A new kind of beast is created by CC that will leave you curiously desperate for more.
This album is more psychodelic, more funny, than their debut. Songs like Baptism, Celestica and Year of Silence are catchy! And I love ''Not in Love'' with Robert Smith vocals. I will listen to (III) now.
I found this album deeper and darker, very impressive work with the lyrics and beats. Baptism and Year of Silence take this to the next level. Masterpiece.
this album is angry, but i dont understand why people fckn in love with that. (I) and (III) much better than (II), but i love Celestica, Baptism, Not In Love, Doe Deer and Suffocation, that's all
Flashing project. The way we go through an atmosphere to another all along this album is simply brilliant. The begenning is agressive and unwelcoming but as deep as you dive into this you will find yourself at home. Crystal Castles excel in mixing rough (we can even call it hardcore) electro to some hovering and transcending beats. The miracle of this album happens when magic appears in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of an almost unbearable music to listen to. In its own agressivity and harshness 'Crystal Castles' turns out to be an album where questions can be asked, where dancing is possible even if unexpected and where violence is to be seen with a tolerant eye.
The best album by Crystal Castles! Fainting Spells, Doe Deer, Year Of Silence, Not In Love are amazing songs///
This is an awesome album to just relax to. I find it hard to judge this album becuase I can't really think whilst listening to it. This is one of those albums that are just meant to be enjoyed.
A relaxing and interesting album. Steady beats hold together the different vocalists floating in and out of these tracks, which are heavy with synths, slap bass, and a distinct 80's mood. "Gaudy Side of Town" is the perfect intro into this album, which of course has a saxophone fluttering in and out. The album centerpiece is "Faded High", which Justin Vernon of Bon Iver shines on.
A fresh, rich and varied offering. Paper Romance and History are definite hits which will keep the masses happy for a long time to come. Dig deeper, and check the album out from start to finish (a few times) and you'll quickly see a creative holistic showcase that I never knew was there. Great Job, kudos to all involved and hopefully more to follow.
Fantastic original style album great session singers and some famous ones. I love you st. Saviour she's fantastic
Over a decade late, this is THE Groove Armada album I keep coming back to. The melancholic chords in Cards To Your Heart, I Won't Kneel, Paper Romance etc, combined with the emotive synths and rich textures evoke a response that pulls on the heart. The only 'duff' track is the one with Bryan Ferry
Uma voz simples mas eficiente, o uso MUITO bem elaborado de um instrumento novo chamado Tenori-On e conhecimento musical. Ã
This album is a great mix of electro pop and tuneful melodies, highly recommended if your into the musical stylings of Ladyhawke and Sleigh Bells!, Recommended for all ages.
Little Boots delivers on her debut album. This serves as a starting point for what I hope to be a exciting and long career. Download: Remedy, Earthquake, Mathematics, Ghost
Slayed! slayed! slayed! good in 2009. Good in 2019. Okay, thanks, im'cant and crying
A lot of just pop filler, but overall this is a good debut from Ke$ha. "Your Love Is My Drug" "Take It Off" and "Animal" are my standout tracks on the album.
Ke$ha is your stereotypical pop artist, one that can not sing. If you have ever heard her live, you will know what I mean. In one point in time, having SOME singing talent was a requirement to be a pop star. Today, all you need to be have is a party girl image and pretend to be drunk everywhere you go. This whole album is full of autotune. Every. Single. Song. Yes, it's catchy. Doesn't mean it's worthy anything.
Too much auto-tune and not enough actual talent. Oh and she can't spell. I refuse to call her Ke-sha, and always refer to her as "Ke-dollar-ha". It's how it's spelled...
Absolutely awful. Despite a couple of catchy beats, the lyrics are so vacuous and trite and the singer's voice so grating (dare I call her a singer? She talks her way through most of the album with the voice of a bratty 13 year old) that any redeeming qualities imparted by beat or production are negated. Ke$ha makes the likes of Britney Spears, Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus look like refined ladies. If I were a singer, I'd be embarrassed to share a label with her. Just YUCK.
This album is mostly filled with Auto-Tune, computerized beeps in the wrong places, and too many songs sounding the same. First of all, we have the actually decent: "Your Love Is My Drug", "Take It Off", "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes", & "Animal". Then we have the average: "Tik Tok", "Stephen", "Hungover", "Party at a Rich Dude's House", & "Blind". Then, come the utterly laughable: "Kiss N' Tell", "Blah Blah Blah", "Backstabber", "Dinosaur", & "Boots & Boys".
Though it feels like it was just yester-year that Kesha—then known as 'Ke$ha'—took a commercial bath in fame, fortune, and glitter in between from the success of her debut single "TiK ToK", it has been nearly half a decade since the release of her debut album Animal and although she's more recently remembered for her rehab stint earlier this year—which actually didn't involve 'a bottle of Jack' in contrast to her nay-sayers—she remains a polarizing figure to the public. For example, her overuse of Auto-Tune made us question her vocal capabilities and with lyrics like "D-I-N-O-S-A-you are a dinosaur", we definitely questioned her songwriting capabilities. Would she be a one-hit wonder? Is she a parody artist or is this actually as deep as it gets in the mind of this Nashville gal-turned-Valley girl? Many of the questions have already been answered, we just never really payed more attention than we should have to learn them. Her 2012 acoustic EP Deconstructed certainly spotlights her ability to sing—why anyone would wanna cover up that quivery-yet-beautifully raw Nashville accent is above me—and considering her lengthy string of top-ten hits since her debut, it's out of question how successful her schtick has sold so far.Let's get to Animal now: to sum it up, depth isn't in this record's ungrammatical vocabulary. Production-wise, Dr. Luke and Max Martin created some of the '10s most guiltiest electropop pleasures out of hits like "Take It Off" and "Your Love Is My Drug", however, while Lady Gaga's 2008 club classic "Just Dance" features some surprisingly well-detailed production to accompany its drunken lyricism, neither of the aforementioned are groundbreaking in any shape or form and often sound so sweet, they rot at the brain like a cavity due to the simplicity. The highlights on the record come from assisting producers like Tom Neville on "Boots & Boys"—spoiler, it lists two primary 'obsessions' that 'bring [her] so much joy'—and the Greg Kurstin-produced title track that could be the most thought-provoking, vulnerable track on the record. Her following EP Cannibal and second studio album Warrior continue to unveil more and more of her impact as a pop icon—albeit very, very calmly. As for now, Animal remains one of her funnest records to date and whether you're a female (or male) teenager experiencing bratty hormonal development or too drunk to understand who or what you are at this moment, it has a lot to offer as far as mindless dance-pop goes.
Um bom album,tem boas músicas,um pouco mais da maioria,por isso o 6.Mas mesmo nas boas faixas,houve um pecado,o auto tune.Ke$ha aprendeu com Animal e fez albuns melhores depois.
This was a nice debut from Kesha, but its production was repetitive and its lyrics didn't show Kesha's talent as a singer and songwriter (which is what she actually is). It's a fun album but it's not capable of doing what Kesha can do. Grade: C. Highlights: "Animal", "Blind", "Dancing with Tears in My Eyes". Worst songs: "Tik Tok", "Dinosaur", "Boots & Boys"
Definitely a contender in the run for Best Album of 2010. The beats are sick (thanks to the genius that is Dr.Luke). The lyrics are sicker. Her voice is so autotuned it's ridiculous...But it all makes for a fun album. A MUST-HEAR album for parties to come. I was ready to write her off as jst another white-trash Britney wannabe...but this girl has BALLS...and i mean BALLS! Songs like "Boots & Boys" & "Take it Off" are basically Britney songs sung in Ke$ha's voice. But the songs have HIT written alll ove them.
No amount of autotune can turn Ke$ha from glittery train wreck into a bona fide Britney competitor cause lets face it - thats all Ke$has after. Take it off and V.I.P are the only great tracks.
It looks like Kesha and Justin Bieber are trying their hardest to to make mainstream music even worse than it is. This album is disgustingly awful, with terrible lyrics and oh so many stutters. She barely even sings; she just talks the lyrics.
I must not have any taste, but this CD makes me smile. I am not sure she is trying to be ironic, but damn if I want to laugh. The beats are catchy. She reminds me of an Uffie, but with better production.
Ke$sha has a hard time understanding her job. Music Artist are supposed to create and break boundaries. Not mock them. "Animal" may be praised for it's catchy tunes. But not all catchy music is good music. With little to no intelligence, "Animal" has to be one of the hardest to listen to albums I've ever heard. Where there are witty and asinine lyrics and abuse use of an Auto-Tune plugin, you get a sound that is under worked, lazy, and overrated.
Well............not good. I Like a lot "Take it Off", but not the other songs.... the sound is the same in all the songs... the kind of album with 2 hits and no substance, like LMFAO's "Sorry for party rocking" but better.( sorry for my English )
To many same sounding songs.
Already think it will be one of the best albums this year!!
After the huge success of 'TiK ToK', all we could expect from Ke$ha was a party-all-the-time-album. Well, seems like the new rising star of 2010 have more than fun to offer in her debut-album 'Animal'. The tracks 'Blind' and 'Dancinw With Tears In My Eyes' show this. But don't be foolish to think that the party here is poorly. 'Take It Off', 'Blah Blah Blah' and 'Party At A Rich Dude's House' are three of the best dance tracks of 2010. Mix all this with a funny-track ('Stephen'), an alternative song-truth ('Animal') and a teenager-adventure ('Backstabber' and 'Dinosaur') and you've got one of the greatest albums of the year.
I'm giving her an 8 just because I enjoy Tik Tok and I think she deserves a little love for it. After listening to the album twice, I can't really remember any of the songs, but there were definitely some chuckle worthy lyrics in there, particularly from the terribad "Dinosaur." She seems a little like a sloppy ho, which resonates with me hahah. I'll look forward to a maybe more thought-through second album.
I love this album, this is what 2010 should sound like. Ke$ha is the next star in today's pop scene.
LOVE this album!!
Despite the ridiculous lyrics the album is a fun catchy dance album!
This is very new music. Some songs sound similar at first listen. The album grows and grows on you. Great album.
Abusive use of synthesizer to mask Kesha's inability to sing this kinda of music (whatever you call it, dance, pop...) has succeeded in fooling most of us (as people are finding it appealing). There is an emergence of electronic music nowadays, but that does not mean that the singer should not care about making use of his/her real voice; after all, singing remains vocal music accompanied by musical arrangements (merely talking all through videogame sounds does not make a song). May be she can try and sing more naturally next time; wish you best Kesha if you read this.
No talent, horrible voice, horrible lyrics, just flat out horrible. The only people who ever like her are preppy teenage girls, and trust me they have horrible taste in entertainment. Also, what were the critics thinking?! 63?! I was expecting this to be a 38 or something. Yet they rate down good bands like Seether, Theory of a Deadman, Nickelback, Hinder, Three Days Grace, and yet rate up this loser....please.
It really is sad that there are people who enjoy this. It's not even music...it's a product of the music industry for a quick buck.
New pop princess Ke$ha proves that she can make hits easily with this re-freshing electro-pop album, 'Animal'. With all songs written by the young starlet, they focus around typical things that happen in life; such as having an untrustworthy friend (Backstabber), going out and having a good time despite having no money (TiK ToK), or feeling lonely without having your lover by your side (Dancing with Tears in My Eyes). With this club banging album that'll be playing on your mp3 all night, I think 'Animal rightfully deserves a 10/10. Perfect material for a rising debut pop star. Adults and Teenagers will love it, it has a very fun anthem to it. Enjoy!
There are only a couple of good songs. There are too many filler songs here. Nothing exciting about this album.
Absolutely awful. Contains some of the worst music I have ever heard and contains some of the dumbest lyrics ever produced. Whoever gave this girl a record label seriously needs to be fired...this scum is stinking up the music world.
This is ubber trash .. the sound and the gimmicky of kesha is just unflattering and her style and music underwhelms and leaves you wanting more.
I'm a teenager and i even think this album sucks it sounds like all the other pop albums of the last decade. More people need to start listening to real music
+1 for being a good looking girl. -10 for the lyric "And now the dudes are lining up cause they hear we got swagger, but we kick em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger." Easily the worst combination of words ever set to music.
Its funny that it's either 0 points or ten points here for this album. seems like most of the people have just decided (by hearing Tik Tok) that she is just one rubbish product of greedy music-industry. well, i totally understand why you think so, though so after hearing tik tok for the first time. ok, her music is lyrically brainless, incredibly catchy (which may annoy some people) mainstream pop with autotuned vocals. despite those facts i am still able to enjoy this album, not as an atistically deep piece of art, but as a fun party-album that makes me want to sing-along and dance around. she has said herself that she made this album to make some people dance, so why you are taking it so seriously? listen to 'party at the rich dudes house' and tell me if you still think she's serious. i give 8 out of ten, because as i previously stated, this is perfect music for going out and having good time.
A Glittery- Pop- Auto-tune Mess with awful hooks and childish lyrics. She brings absolutely nothing new to the Pop table and appeals primarily to pre-teenage girls who could care less about its terrible lyrics. Granted there is a decent song in there in "Animal" but the record as a whole is beyond awful.
Ke$ha is a the whore version of Taylor Swift, and I am not gonna lie but her cd is very catchy.

It's perfect for when you want a pulsating migrane. If you respect yourself and love music, just avoid Kesha at all costs. I mean, for the love of God, if she keeps getting money for this "music" she'll never leave.
Listened to this album with a completely open mind, and it was still absolutely horrible.
Another bad debut album. The lyrics are easily some of the most stupid ever. I'm a teenager and even i think this sounds terrible. Go listen to some real music.
Lets dissect this album. Lyrics:0 Quality:0 Musical Talent:0 Oh and BTW, everyone look up The Party by Justice ft. Uffie. Then come back to me and ask why Justice doesn't sue the living god out of Kesha.
Gutter-trash lyrics over Disney Channel beats... Who is this album even for? If "Ke$ha" is attempting to be a joke, it's working... her problem is that it's just not funny. Luckily, no one will know who she is 6 months from now.
Nothing fun about this album...just some girl who keeps drinking about alcohol. Boring.
I hate this album as much as the next guy but please quit crying about how much music has become a commodity because its really embarassing that I constantly see people going up to a tombstone entitled "real music" leaving flowers and crying. Ok i never really saw that but the way you people act, it might as well be. Calm down people sheesh, Its just music, not your life.
God-awful to say the least. Redundant, the inappropriate and ineffective usage of Auto-Tube and the slutty drunk party girl persona. Honestly, sometimes you can even differentiate songs from another and discern when a song ends. You can thank my roommate for this review. Buy: N/ADownload: N/ASkip: Everything except "Take It Off" which deserves one listen but no download
A great debut album, Ke $ ha knew well the effect of using auto-tune, their songs are fun to dance and forget their problems, is a complete album made for fun, as well as the artist, it may seem commercial but is nonetheless a good album.Highlights: Tik Tok and AnimalLows: Hungover and Boots And Boys
Utter crap. The music biz is already way too diluted with garbage. This is worse than garbage. Let's hope she goes away for good. I saw her on Conan O'Brien. Stupid song, stupid lyrics and lame trashy manufactured MTV persona.
Horrible, just plain horrible. Lyrics, Beats, and the HEAVY use of Auto-tune is disturbing. But I don't know who is worse though, her or Soulja Boy?
Absolutely horrible "music" that is more or less a copy of Uffie. How talking over beats with poor lyricism can be be considered music is anyone's guess. Rappers are much more clever than Ke$sha. Maybe the dollar sign in her name signifies how much it's worth?
If Lady Gaga were a character on Jersey Shore, she'd be Ke$ha. Absolute garbage.
utterly stupid. go listen to smashing pumpkins
Only fun to listen to when you're wasted and making fun of it.
It's funny how the Auto-tuned Lady Gaga, Ke$ha, earned so much money in the music industry. While musical talents like Bjork are trying to gather people's attention by using her original voice and avant-garde themed music, Ke$ha is just a girl who wants to get fame instantly without corcerning her music. Whoever says Ke$ha is good for making fun music is wrong. When you listen to the album, the first few things you will find hating in this album are the wasted lyrics and deafening Auto-tuned Ke$ha's voice. Ke$ha does not even use her own voice in the album. It's like a robot was making this album more than Ke$ha did. The lyrics are good only when you are in the club, starting fights or putting yourself in shame either you are totally drunk or high on drugs. I say Lady Gaga is a lousy artist. Yet, Ke$ha makes Lady Gaga similar to Kate Bush because she's so much worse than the bad Lady Gaga. It'll be a miracle to her if this album will be remembered as long as Diana Ross' album did.
Much like Lady Gaga's "The Fame", Ke$ha's "Animal" is one of the most well-polished successors to Britney Spears' "Blackout". Hard to listen at first, it becomes very enjoyable after multiple listens though intellectually, she never seems to veer away from the drunk materialistic gal she's embodying in every song or video. Even so, her portrayal is sincere and rocking and the fact that she doesn't give a f*ck what you think makes the music more enjoyable to listen to. A drunk record with a drunk soul.
The debut album from Ke$ha is certainly a good one! Although the auto tune can be quite unkind at times theres no doubt the tracks on this are lyrically amazing and they will get you dancing! If you take a look at the 4 singles released TiK ToK,Blah Blah Blah,Your Love Is My Drug and Take It Off, most people just think its an album full of party tracks, wrong. Look at songs like Stephen, Blind and Dancing With Tears In My Eyes. Overall a favourable album with highlights such as TiK ToK, Animal, Your Love Is My Drug, Blind and Take It Off. The only low i can find in the whole album would be Boots & Boys, i just dont really like the song personally. If you dont have the album yet, pick it up now its worth it!
A fun album, but too much auto-tune. Other than "Tik Tok", there are standout tracks including fun bops such as "Your Love Is My Drug", "Take It Off", "Kiss n Tell", and "Animal". Overall a moderate debut album for Kesha.
Well, I was running through the comments and all I see is people judging her about the auto tune. Weirdly or not, that was Kesha's mark back in 2010. Animal is the party girl's debut, with a lot of club songs with a diferencial: They talk about her everyday experiencies untill she finally got her spot in pop music. That's whats cool about Kesha, even though she is a pop star now, she'll never get rid of her old and vodka stained jeans. She kinda reinvented the trash pop with this amazing and well produced album. And C'mon, she slayed the pop charts with it's singles.
Surprisingly addictive. I keep listening to it over and over. Very catchy, funny, and there are some real hits on here. Favorite song right now is the title track Animal
It's slutty, naughty, sleezy and over-produced. But that is the very reason as to why its such a success. Kesha comes off the streets and into our ears with one of the raunchiest albums of the year. But as drunken and atroshish as this album may be, her heart fills each song to its fullest like the cups of alcohol she has in her hands. Each song is frisky and fun, not trying to be a political statement or the next song you will hear at church. Kesha doesn't play by the rules and doesn't give a shit. Finally, an album that is pure joy and fluff (good fluff that it is). One-night stands and bottles of jack have never seemed so sophisticated.
Takes the inane debauchery of pop music and exaggerates it to a facetious extreme that is both fun and funny. Ke$ha is part of a new generation of pop artists including Lady Gaga, in that any kind of sincerity is forgone in favor of practicing the "art" of popular music. This album has so many quotable lines it is sure to spread wildly and float regardless of critical response. With 5+ radio-worthy tracks, this album is a tailor-made sensation.
Love it......I'm sure the haters are either 30-something or only care about rockbands :) music doesn't have to be serious all the time.....HAVE A LIL FUN!
I love Ke$ha. I'm a teenager and I think her music is very different to most artist atm. I've listened Uffie before and Ke$ha kind is like the complete oppesites as the both make music about oppersite things. (listen to Uffie Dismissed and Ke$ha Blah Blah Blah too understand what I'm saying) so I don't see why people are comparing, If I compared Ke$ha too someone it would be Lady Gaga as there both electronica and make music about the same sort of things. But anyway Good album, I love pretty much all of it XD my fav song is Your Love is My Drug.
With Animal, Ke$ha proves that she can make a nice-use of the auto-tune, with many danceable songs, despite this, we can't even say if she has any vocal ability.
She has sass and i'll say that. The album has just a tad bit to much auto-tune to it. Yet songs like "Kiss n Tell" and "Your Love is My Drug" are obvious best. The worst " Take it Off". It has just too much auto-tuned to it.Though the dance sound is nice at many times.
Animal have (like the most of the albums) a message on the lyrics. The message of Animal is: "it's party time". The album's lyrics are about party and that's good because in this world full of concerns, you need to forget it and chill out. However, the album take that party message to a extreme. The album in an only word: "catchy".
Her debut album is neither bad nor too good. It is good. Her songs are catchy and fun. The album is made for the dancefloor from "Your Love Is My Drug" to "Animal." Her techno-ballads possess that dancefloor beat. Lyrically, TiK ToK, Back$tabber, and etc is bad, "trying too hard", and empty. I love the rhythm and beats but the alcoholic lyrics is not needed.
I am a little ashamed to say that I really liked this album. Some may say a lot of bad things, but in it, there is tons of great songs. I mean, "Tik Tok" already entered on the world pop culture. A lot of singers have covered this song, it appeared on Simpsons, and even earned a fun video parody with Star Wars. Everyone that listened to the song, got it stuck on their minds. I mean, it's not clever, but this is the POP song that we have been waiting since Britney Spears' "Toxic." But there are other two song extremely good on the album: "Take It Off", a hard song that is incredibly catchy and "Animal" that is the one that everyone that says that Kesha doesn't write good music should listen to. "Hungover" is another song that shows a different side of her. I mean, you will like this album, if you do not take it seriously.
Kesha might abuse her charm here and there, but Animal is an overly obnoxious, yet addictive guilty pleasure that spotlighted Kesha's fame and fortune. Overall, Animal gives us a hint of how crazily creative Kesha is in the studio, but let's hope she's a little more professional in her second studio album.
This is a great tornado of destruction. The auto-tune is the great emperor in the crisp voice of Ke$ha, creating an eerie echo and thundering. Tracks like "Tik Tok" and "Blah, Blah, Blah" are simply sharp arrows going at high speed directly to your eardrums. Just say, disappointing.
Ke$ha is what a lot of pop stars are these days -- spunky and obnoxious. Animal is nevertheless a generic, yet irresistibly catchy dance album that is adequately produced, but notoriously cheap. Its standout track is its lead single, "TiK ToK", which is -- again -- irresistibly catchy. However, a lot of its weakness draws from tracks such as "Backstabber", that are flooded in heavy amounts of Auto-Tune and sound like they were recorded on GarageBand.
Several songs, such as Blah Blah Blah and Take It Off, are very catchy - and that's all. Autotune is used on almost every track and is sometimes extremely irritating and makes all songs sound the same. It is good that she contributed to the songwriting on every track, but only some of them are worth a listen.
...............................................................The way she presents herself in this album and in public is trash. She is one of the worst Brittney Spears ripoffs.
Many say this album was "the best of 2010" or "the best way to begin the new decade". I beg to differ. Very few of these songs here are actually enjoyable. Actually, I can't think of one that I truly, solidly enjoyed. "Your Love Is My Drug", "TiK ToK", "Blah Blah Blah", and "Take It Off" are all stupid.
Talk about filler! There are only 6 good tracks, the 4 singles, her appearance on the Taio Cruz record dirty picture and 1 album track called kiss and tell. The other 10 songs sound exactly the same and even the youth of today would cringe at the lyrics and the production could of been done by children. The only reason why I give it a 4 is because 6 of the tracks are good. If I was you I would just buy the 5 singles.
The songs on Animal are catchy, but a lot of them are too similar and generic. Ke$ha does display a lot of personality on the album. Although there was a bit too much auto-tune, one thing I liked seemed to pop up on a few of the songs' final hooks: the way her vocals were layered (on Animal, DWTIME, KnT, Blind). Unfortunately, Ke$ha doesn't display as much talent as she has.
There are many earworms on this album, but Kesha's delivery is the same in each song. It's part of her appeal, but it gets old quite fast. Once again I keep admiring the people who wrote these songs (it's not easy to write light pop songs that you can hum after hearing them once) rather than the performer. And after seeing Kesha live at some TV shows, it's clear that she needs autotune for more than just a cool sound effect.
The songs on this album don't differ much in sound, but they are catchy throughout the whole album. Most of them show some kind of lack of intelligent lyrics, but the album is still good enough to have several good moments (Take It Off, Backstabber and Dancing With Tears in My Eyes).
If you are a fan of the over-use of auto-tune, bad songwriting, and horrible vocal skills, then this truly is the album for you. However, if u have "ears" like the rest of us do, then it is not.
After 20+ listenings I would give the album an A.After a while you learn to appreciate each and every song on this fun dance pop album. It's -as is clearer now- certainly an album with a clear organic connection to the singer. I would suggest listening to Animal Inside, a very beautiful song.
Nice debut album from Ke$ha that managed to deliver a string of hits. It's pure party pop music, and sure Ke$ha might not have the best voice but it's a fun album and full of catchy songs. Worth buying :)

If you overlook the intense autotune use, this album was actually very good. Ke$ha shows the world it's okay to be crazy and fun loving, with humorous lyrics and catchy beats.
I love this CD! This is not a "mixed or average" CD! This is Ke$ha's best work, and you can see that in the songs. And songs like "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes" show that Ke$ha isn't just a party girl.
While this album is generic pop, its well done generic pop. All the songs are very catchy. Especially Backstabber and Kiss 'n' Tell are songs you'll be singing to within three listens.

"Animal" is not a phenomenal album but it is not completely bad either. It's fun, danceable, enjoyable and a true expositor of electro-pop.
Good solid pop album. This album will be a good album to look back on in the future to remind me of how music sounded in the early 2010s
Шикарный альбом! Даже не понятно, почему такая Низкая оценка!?
Animals album is a pop perfection & pop banger with amazing & meaningful songs.
I used to LOATHE Lady Gaga and was BAFFLED at why everyone enjoyed her so much. I even made a playlist of my favorite music which included: C,S,N and Young, James Brown, The Police, Jefferson Airplane, The Doors, Aretha... just to name a few, and I called this playlist "Lady Gaga is Going to Die"... I did this because I felt like society was really F***ed up to think that this girl had talent. With this album, however, she completely changed my mind. I may not be a "Gagamaniac", but I certainly respect her at least. Just enjoy it for it's musicality. Not what she says, but how she says it, and how the music enhances these feelings she is trying to make into this... music. It's certainly beautiful and breathtaking at times. With this being leaps and bounds better than her first album, I wait for what she will come up with in the future.
A beautiful album by Lady Gaga, it's even better than the first one.
Amazing melodies, amazing lyrics, amazing vocals... Simply, one of the greatest pop albums of the 21st century.
Magic. Pure perfection. This album is flawless. Every single song is a whole different world. Each record has been developed precisely. The music and the lyrics couldn't be more flawless. RedOne + Gaga mix shines more than ever with the songs they have created together. AMAZING. I have no words to describe.
This album is amazing, each track flows into each other and they are crafted with perfection. All the songs on the album are flat out amazing. Best tracks are "Bad Romance" "Telephone" "Alejandro" "Dance in the Dark" and "Monster and "So Happy I Could Die"100% A+
I always want hear a record like that. All the songs are catchy and strongers, with could reach the #1 for seasons . Powerful voice and though Gaga thought that BTW would be her best album I think it's the best ( not too far )
One of the most beautiful and wonderful album i've ever heard... I love lady gaga. This album is absolutely perfect, and poethic. Dance in the dark, Bad romance, Alejandro, So happy i could die, Teeth, Monster every song of this album is a powerful mix of great things!
The Fame Monster is the bridge to Lady Gagaâ
Let me just say I love Lady Gaga,and I think anyone who reads this should know that.I think this is an incredible album.The darker tone is immediately apparent,especially in "Alejandro".All the songs are fantastic,so if you're a Lady Gaga fan,I highly recommend it,but you've probably already bought it.My only nitpick with the album is that it is censored,which is irritating.Despite that,The Fame Monster is incredible,and can be bought in the standard 1 disc version,or the 2 Disc Deluxe Edition,which has The Fame Monster,plus The Fame CD with 3 new songs.The song "Again Again" was removed however,but not a huge loss.In the end,I highly recommend Lady Gaga's The Fame Monster.
Um dos melhores Ã¡lbuns de 'dance music' que jÃ¡ foi feito. Com apenas 8 mÃºsicas, Lady Gaga consegue uma sonoridade incrÃ­vel. Os hits sÃ£o viciantes demais, cada um com suas peculiaridades. Foi com este Ã¡lbum que ela mostrou que veio para ficar.Melhores Faixas: Bad Romance / Telephone / Dance in the Dark
The Fame Monster was a perfect pop era and can most likely never be re-done. What better way to start off a new EP/CD than to bleed to death on the MTV VMA's? GaGas. ideas and presentation of fame has been quite remarkable. While presenting us with loads of artistic visions and clothes from fashion designers with ideas no ones ever seen she manages to give us radio friendly modern dance-pop masterpieces. Songs like Telephone and Bad Romance have cemented their way onto pop culture history and while her songs are portrayed to have more meaning than they probably do, it just adds more spark and life to her act. After all Lady GaGa goes beyond an album and singles. She's managed to make it on the top grossing tours EVER. Her act is remarkable and this 8 song classic will be a staple for any pop fan for decades to come. Standouts: Alejandro and Dance in the Dark
This Album is fill with dancing songs and great hook. Like Bad Romance and Telephone. Other songs like Dance in the Dark and Alejandro are great songs! This album was also a big break for Lady GaGa, Bad Romance and Telephone help her make money. She is a great Artist and this Album kicked her off w/ a great year. Overall it's a 10 and it's a great Album.
This, in my most honest opinion is 'Pop-Gold'. Lady Gaga has done a fantastic job in translating the monster that is fame (in her eyes) into pure genuine Pop music. From the lyrical content, her amazing vocals and the great production, 'The Fame Monster' is a Pop masterpiece.Must Downloads: All of them!
Bad Romance to Teeth - all of them are just pure masterpieces, no flaws detected in any of the 8 golden tracks on this fantastic album. Loving this album very much.
This EP is considered her best piece of music by many, and there are a lot of reasons to this. 8 fabulous tracks, not only on their productions but also on Gaga's fantastic vocals on all of them. Congratulations to the queen!
All these songs in this album have the strong for been singles, i can say wih more confidence than ever that this album is a bible of pop music my darling's
An EP that deserved to be an album in full, with great songs to sing, dance, only listen or do what you want, that's what that year was in need and Gaga did a great job on it.Highlights: Telephone and Bad RomanceLows: So Happy I Could Die and Alejandro
Catchy hooks, dance tunes, that wake up the party animal inside. The successful EP follow up to the massive, gigantic hit "The Fame" certainly did not leave fans disappointed. One of the most, if not the most excellent pop releases in the 2000s.
Though there is no denying that The Fame is a much better album, The Fame Monster stays more consistant than The Fame with its dark, mysterious tone, something that The Fame didn't pull off.
I think that the sounds present in the songs of 'The Fame Monster' is quite original and I really appreciate the work of Lady Gaga, and I really like all the songs in the album and I think that the best tracks are Bad Romance and Speechless. Although the lyrics can often be no deep meanings or worthy of note I really love the simplicity of the melodies and choruses, which in any case does not diminish the skill and talent of the artist
One of - if not the - best album of the decade. Lady Gaga continues the revolution in pop that made â
Lady Gaga's second album, The Fame Monster, is not fun. Neither is it sexy, nor is it jubilant. And it definitely isn't pretty. It's masterful. It's elusive, dark, catchy, rhythmical, inharmonic, satirical (at some points even humorous), and musically brilliant. It's Gaga's tour de force, her assertion into the pop-musical realm, her footprint in the cemented road of musical development in the 2k decade. Gaga, in collaboration with writers RedOne, Fernando Garibay, and Space Cowboy, proves that she, in fact, can escape the squid-like suction cups of radio music, while holding on to the classic pop templates that seem to be necessary to create a decently successful album. It's as if you gave Lady Gaga the Mona Lisa, and she transformed it into an austere Origami swan. The use of dissonance in this album is coherent and will not go unrecognized. She is effectively able to make music with making harmony, a difficult task for those artists that want to remain popular. The production value in this album is immense, much greater than her previous album, and for once, it doesn't detract from the true sound she tries to make. She doesn't hide her music deeply. In this album, she levels it above everything. It is important to note, though, that ugly does not make a song. Some moments in this album, we have to bear with the non-musical ugly, which may not be fun (and at some points, isn't even necessary to get the full effect of the album).Overall, Gaga's The Fame Monster gives us the impression that Gaga isn't just some hooker off the street. She cares about her music, like her album is her baby, and transfers as much personality and life into it as she can, making sure to include both the good and bad of her. Her album leaves us satisfied, but because of it's length, also leaves us hungry for more.
Every track is absolutely amazing!! And every track has its own poweful meaning. The album is very well put together, and the production keeps you waving and dancing all day long. Highlights : every song x3 but Bad Romance for the best!
In some critics say that in The Fame Monster, Gaga It really brought us something unique, bringing surprising lyrics, melodies and different rhythms. INNOVATIVE
Her best album !
Her masterpiece ,creative and original album, much better than Born This Way and The Fame, I like every song but the best song is Bad Romance in my opinion.
Realy great album.Great songs,great music videos!
If only Gaga stopped here, she would have spared herself a tonne of hate. The Fame Monster is exceptionally good - 8 perfect tracks. I can't not give this a solid 10 rating, since there is not much to not love on this one (except maybe the not-so-original Alejandro video, but the song is great anyway). If you're new to Gaga, this is the one I'd go for (the only one in fact). Avoid anything that came after this. Personal favourites: Bad Romance, Dance in the Dark, So Happy I Could Die, Teeth (which is also the best Gaga song to date in my opinion)
Brilliant. The best release of 2009, which certainly gave the best singles and videos of 2010. Album highlights: Bad Romance, Teeth. Simply Pop-perfection.
Absolutely perfect message, the fame isn't that paradise we think, every music treat about different mistakes and causes, well produced and a great sequence for the previous album.
"The Fame Monster" made me a Monster actually, and more particularly with "So Happy I Could Die" and "Dance In The Dark". Gaga proved that she wasamazing with "The Fame", which more aimed at dancing and enjoying ourselves. Each of 8 songs of "The Fame Monster" stands for a fear and Gaga made awesome songs out of them. We already knew that it would be a great album because of "Bad Romance". I personally think that "Alejandro" and "Telephone" are the greatest songs and hits. This is so POP and the world must listen to this breathtaking album.
One Of The Greatest Pop Albums Of All Time! The Lyrics Her Voice.. Magic
Good pop album. This was Gaga at her finest. Bad Romance, Telephone and Alejandro are some of her finest singles. Amazing! .
A monument in pop music. It revolutionizes pop and will forever mark its print. The reason why Gaga is so good is that she is the chameleon of music: switching from Abba to Christina from song to another. She is simply deserving for the nomination of Album of the Year, just Arcade Fire is better.
Another bible of pop! Art and Gaga's criativity, you'll find here. My favorites:1 - Bad Romance2 - Dance in the Dark3 - Alejandro4 - Monster5 - Telephone6 - Teeth7 - So Happy I Could Die8 - Speechless (I prefer this one live, is so much better!)
This, in my most honest opinion is 'Pop-Gold'. Lady Gaga has done a fantastic job in translating the monster that is fame (in her eyes) into pure genuine Pop music. From the lyrical content, her amazing vocals and the great production, 'The Fame Monster' is a Pop masterpiece.
Anyone who likes pop and isn't deaf would like it. It contains one of the best pop songs of the decade ("Bad Romance") and that, alone, says an awful lot about it.
Lady Gaga comes back with an ever better album than her debut, 'The Fame'. She powers through the charts with standout tracks 'Bad Romance' and 'Telephone', and yet, still shines on less recognised tracks such as 'Monster' and the moving ballad 'Speechless'. The album that solidified who she was as an artist, Lady Gaga is far from over.

This is the best pop album of the 21st century. With the icy electropop instrumentals and the catchy hooks of songs that are all single-worthy, Gaga makes it hard to top herself. "Dance in the Dark", "Monster", and "Bad Romance" are essential must-listens on the album. I promise that you won't regret giving this album a listen.
Tão bom quanto ao The fame.Monster 10Speechless 10Dance in the Dark 9.5So Happy I Could Die 9.5Essas são as músicas que ouço até hoje depois de 4 anos do lançamento.
The Fame Monster is much darker than its predecessor, The Fame, and is one of the most iconic albums to be released in this millennium. With standout tracks such as Bad Romance, Alejandro, Speechless, Dance In The Dark, Telephone, and So Happy I Could Die, this is Gaga at her finest.
All of the songs are amazingly catchy and nice, and Gaga proves that she has the vocals to sing as well.She's an all rounded singer, and can dance, sing and is particularly good LIVE, compared to other modern-day singers.
This Is Good Not As Good As Her 1st CD But Still Good :) Go GAGA!
Pop music has a bad reputation: repetition, laziness, the lack of anything by the singer. Thankfuly, artists like GaGa do exist. Producing a -highly- solid (and not all radio friendly) albums with masterful songs causing 'Born This Way' to nearly burst at the seems, it stands tribute that Pop music is a genre like any other, though highly infused with rock and electronic also. Most stand out tracks for me are 'Bloody Mary', 'Heavy Metal Lovers' and 'Government Hooker'. A must buy.
So Happy I Could, Speechless, Alejandro, Dance In The Dark and Monster are amazing tracks. The only reason it's not 100 is because there is Telephone.
By far the best pop album of 2009. Way better than The Fame, 8 amazing tracks, no fillers. The vocals are great as well. Standouts - Bad Romance, Dance In The Dark.
The album is perfect in its own way and every song in the album is definitely enjoyable to listen. It showed Lady Gaga in a different side as compared to her previous album.
I remember the first time I heard 'Bad Romance,' having barely recovered from Lady Gaga's explosion onto the music scene with her debut album, The Fame; I couldn't believe the song I was hearing was Gaga. It sounded nothing like 'Poker Face,' and at first, my heart skipped a beat.But therein lies the strength of The Fame Monster; as a whole, the CD is nothing like its predecessor. While The Fame succeeds in being an in-your-face, shameless pop/dance tour de force about the rise to and struggle for fame, The Fame Monster takes a step back and analyzes the consequences of said actions. The result is a staggeringly good piece of pop, showing Gaga's darker (and stronger) musical side. Songs like 'Dance in the Dark' and 'Bad Romance' push the boundaries of pop music and challenge other artists to follow Gaga in creating pop that isn't (gasp) mindless, while others like 'Telephone' play to the strengths that allowed her to become this famous in the first place. The Fame Monster blows The Fame out of the water and nearly makes the original 14 track album seem of such low quality (which it definitely is not) that you'd wish she'd debuted with this one instead.
This masterpice is Lady Gaga's best album. I really love it. I can listen this album 24/7. 'Bad Romance' - 10/10, 'Alejandro' - 10/10, 'Monster' - 10/10, 'Speechless' - 10/10, 'Dance in The Dark' - 10/10, 'Telephone' - 10/10, 'So Happy I Could Die' - 10/10, 'Teeth' - 10/10. Perfect album.
The Fame Monster is perfect from start to finish (although the ending track 'Teeth' is a bit of a bad spot, but still listen-able), the album is a perfect juxtaposition of the glamorization of 'The Fame' that the first album highlighted, taking on a darker view on the fame. I can't choose a top track, because they are all personal favourites for different reasons, although 'Dance In The Dark' probably has the edge; but only just. 'Speechless', a piano-ballad which Gaga wrote after her father told her about a heart condition he was not planning on getting sorted, is solely written by Gaga herself, and really shows off her lyrical capabilities. To round up, the album can be easy listening AND yet provide room for thought if you listen close enough, it's a basis of what pop records should be.
Good things comes in small packages and this is it. This eight tracks EP is one of Lady Gaga's best work. It's not too long or too short. You must definitely check it out. My favourite tracks from the album would be Bad Romance, Dance In The Dark and Alejandro.
This was her best album yet! Bad Romance made her world famous and now she is reaping the rewards. This album is also mentioned as the best of 2000's decade by The Rolling Stones and TIME 100 :)
Este Ã¡lbum Ã© realmente bom. Mostra uma verdadeira evoluÃ§Ã£o em relaÃ§Ã£o ao Ã¡lbum The Fame, uma GaGa mais evoluÃ­da, mÃ¡, esse Ã¡lbum Ã© formado por grandes mÃºsicas, Bad Romance, que mostra o verdadeiro pop, uma mÃºsica onde nÃ£o existe ninguÃ©m que pelo menos sabe uma parte dela. Telephone, uma mÃºsica bem agitada, uma mÃºsica nem boa, nem ruim. Alejandro, outra mÃºsica que caiu na boca do povo na parte Alealejandro Alealejandro, Speechless, que foge do rÃ­timo do Ã¡lbum com uma mÃºsica bela e romÃ¢ntica, pena nÃ£o virar single. Dance In The Dark, a melhor do Ã¡lbum, Lady Gaga decidiu-la jogar fora. Teeth, uma mÃºsica que realmente lembra um exÃ©rcito, missÃµes, boa mÃºsica e ambÃ©m a animada So Happy I Cold Die, viciante tambÃ©m. Esse Ã¡lbum merece um 9.5, mas como nÃ£o existe 9.5, fica para 10 :)
PERFECT Album, Dance in The Dark, Alejandro, Bad Romance, Telephone, Teeth..... Perfect musics, dark album pop is perfect, Lady GaGa is the new queen of pop, no more questions, **** please.
I loved this album she has such an amazing talent no other singer has and has such an odd choice in wardrobe!!!! As gaga forever said "GAGA WILL NEVER BE TOPPED"
This Is One Of The Only Albums I Loved Every Single Song On It!Amazing Perfect Gaga
A great product of the Lady herself, Gaga has managed to create an album that is near faultless. From the opening Euro-sleazy Bad Romance to the showful, almost narcissistic sounding Teeth, the album doesn't fall flat or dry. Highlights include the lead single, the bustling sounds of Telephone, the 80's touch of Dance In the Dark and the crusty rock-esque vocals on the ballad Speechless. Without doubt one of Lady Gaga's finest and most cohesive piece of music to date and a treat for the fans or pop culture everywhere.
This album is better than The Fame & Born This Way. The best songs are So Happy I Could Die and Monster. The concept of the album is interesting. I want to have her new record!
This album is going to be seen as a milestone in Gaga's career. I'm pretty sure. This album not only gives you 8 hit tracks to listen to, it also follows a concept and has a deeper meaning which is getting expressed on every single track. It's simply flawless and a stands head and shoulders above its competitors.Highlights are Bad Romance, Alejandro and Dance in The Dark.
A jaw-dropping album. I honestly think every song on here could've been a single except for Speechless, and that one's only because the subject matter is too personal and emotional for top 40 radio. At a trim 34 minutes long, it's clear Gaga went out of her way to only use the best she had to offer. Alejandro and Teeth are the weakest songs on here, but both are still worth listening to. Telephone sounds out of place from the rest of the album, but it works just fine on its own. But Monster, Dance in the Dark, and Bad Romance are the tracks that'll keep you coming back again and again.
Es un gran album. Lady Gaga inicia una nueva de musica pop con Bad romance, beats de los beats, después toca más palos como en Teeth, en teeth o baladas como speechless. Uno de los mejor discos POP de la historia.
The second album of Gaga prove her fascinating talent, she is unique, there aren't anyone like her, she is a "brand", her lyrics are amazing and she has re-created pop music, nothing is the same since she is there.
This album was Gaga's peak for a reason. It is a simply sublime work of pop art. I shake my head over the pop music being made today and this album is one of the few beacons of hope for the genre. Now, I have a very unpopular opinion that Telephone was not all that. I believe it's one of her most basic recordings and too generic, and is the only "meh" moment on this otherwise perfect album. The Fame Monster's diversity is really astonishing. From the industrial sound of Bad Romance, the Latin pop elements of Alejandro, the 80's pop of Monster, the Elton John-esque Speechless, the ravetastic Dance In The Dark, the heavenly So Happy I Could Die and the sexy, kooky, Teeth, this album is a stunner from start to finish. There have been many debates even among fans as to whether this constitutes an album or an EP. Well, outwith it having 8 tracks that altogether last over 34 minutes, longer than some 10 track albums, I have never seen an EP gain this much sales, fame, get nominated for album of the year at the Grammys and generate a second world tour grossing $227 million. So I believe it is an album. And speaking of the Grammys, it was an absolute travesty that this masterpiece did not win Album of the Year. But its sales and legenadary status mean the public has spoken. A classic is born.
Pretty much every song on this album is stuffed with symbolism, and it's quite beautiful. A lot of the songs are really dark and show a lot of her struggles. It's one of the best albums I've heard in a while.
The album is so amazing...My favorite single: Bad Romance and AlejandroMy favorites tracks: So Happy I Could Die, Dance In The Dark and Monster.
Not as good as "Born This Way", but better than "The Fame". Even though it is has only eight tracks, all of them are catchy. My favorite song is "So Happy I Could Die".
Este album es sorprendente, es uno de los mejores álbumes del Pop, junto con el productor Redone logra crear sonidos realmente buenos e interesantes, canciones realmente oscuras como So Happy i Could Die o Teeth suenan como lo mejor del album.
lady gaga is amazing, she knows how to write powerful songs with a good chorus, she´s so professional, she is so good, she sings so good too, she got the future, the future of music and the fame monster is the best album of the year you know what i´m trying to say, i´m trying to say that she has passion and her album is amazing since the beginning until the end
overall this is a very pleasing experience. This record is inspired by electro-house and a modern take on drum and bass and it blends beautifully. even-though this record only counts 8 songs, it's one of the more solid works ever put out by a pop-singer. the only two downsides of this record is the pummeling and non-cohesive 'teeth' and the slightly generic 'telephone'. every other song however is a fine work of pop and art.
Definitivamente uno de los mejores EP de nuestros años. Con The Fame Monster Lady Gaga impulsa su búsqueda de la Fama, tocando el lado oscuro que ésta conlleva.Aunque podría parecer arriesgada, la experimentación en este disco es soberbia, lejos de ser pretenciosa. Definitivamente uno de los discos más oscuros y a la vez luminosos de nuestros días.Canciones como Bad Romance, Dance in the Dark o So Happy I Could Die son sólo una muestra de la henealidad de Lady Gaga.
This is Lady Gaga at her top. Every single song on this EP is well produced and i really enjoyed everything. The only reason i don't gave it a 10 is because "teeth" could be better.
This is a Beautiful album, Lady Gaga wrotte amazing songs, such inspirational! es hermoso, tiene canciones perfectas como Bad Romance y Dance in the Dark, canciones que inspiran como Speechless, canciones que te van a hacer bailar como Telephone! es grandioso!
The Fame Monster is basically one of the best albums out there. The dark theme of the album is very nice and every song is different. I still love listening to this album even though it's been years since it's came out. I LOVE every song. This is a must have album for anyone who loves Lady Gaga or Pop Music!My Personal favorites are: Bad Romance, Alejandro, Monster, Telephone, Dance in the Dark, and So Happy I Can Die
Esse CD ouro puro, cada musica que está nele poderia ser um single de sucesso. Tem muita musica que eu escuto até hoje e fico "como eu queria um videoclipe dessa musica". aquele álbum que você leva pra vida.
Her best album yet, full of catchy songs that make you get up and start dancing. It is fun, and full of great songs for clubs, this is a unique album that deserves our applause.
An excellent extension to her Fame album, The Fame Monster keeps up with the quality of its predecessor, with even more depth and an overall tone that's darker and more defined. The songs from this album would go on to win her more fans, with the likes of Bad Romance & Telephone, becoming huge smashes worldwide. Its edgier feel puts this album forth as one that will be thoroughly memorable. More significantly, this album spawned music videos that drove her popularity to stardom, with the highly-acclaimed first two singles taking charge at the 2011 Video Music Awards.On a personal note, this is my favourite album off my CD collection (one that has more than a hundred copies), with it taking the most spins on my stereo. The reason why I adore Gaga so much, and where I'd say I derive my audio pleasure and satisfaction.Standout Tracks: Bad Romance, Speechless, Dance In The Dark, Telephone (ft. Beyoncé)
With the follow up to "The Fame", anticipation was high and the pressure was on the newcomer Lady Gaga to prove herself to the world - in this 8 song epic concept album, she does just that. Each song represents a different monster/fear. Bad Romance, for example is the fear of love monster, and Telephone is the fear of suffocation. The songs go much harder here than on "The Fame" although they don't lose their disco edge. Along with the fear of the album, we have an underlying sadness, which is really evident in songs such as "So Happy I Could Die" and "Monster". Considered by many to be the pop icon's finest release, Fame Monster proved that Gaga was not going away anytime soon.
My favorite album of the all time produced by Lady Gaga, I don't think she will be ever able to top this, because it has everything, from amazing performances to flawless songs, I really enjoyed Bad Romance!I give it a fat 10!
This album is no doubt her best, its so dark and catchy, I loved every track my only complaint would be that alejandro was a single, when tracks such as dance in the dark, speechless and monster are far superior.
Album maravilhoso que traz canções maravilhosas como Dance In The Dark,Alejandro e até Teeth.Bad Romance é o grande naipe-pop do album.E Telephone é só o recheio.
A rare album, with eight tracks that has the power to win Grammys and make the artist live in another level of the fame. That's what Gaga created! The Fame Monster has impressive, catchy and original songs and the lyrics are unreal. This is an album that just LADY GAGA can sing, others are not capable.One word to define it: EPIC!
It is an awesome album. There are so many good tracks on this 2 CDs. My favourite tracks are Bad Romance, Monster, Brown Eyes, Love Games and of cause Poker Face. The value is really high and I fell not the slightest regret for buying this album.
Where every Gothic pop started, Gaga created an explosion of thoughts, erotically or romantically, for a blast of sick tunes and heavy beats big enough to turn the pop music history upside down.
One of her best works, truly the album/EP of the decade. No one not even her (although we hope) will top this EP. The song choices and lyrics are very dark and beautifully written. This is easily worth ANY amount you may pay for it. a masterpiece
you can not explain how this album was amazing, deserved to be universally acclaimed because gaga worked very well in it , is one of the true influential albums of the current POP , finally , he was very good for all
Just a perfect pop album, there's no waste on any of its 8 songs. Just the fist song ''Bad Romance'' is a prelude of how great is the rest of the album.
"Teeth" can not destroy this genuine work of art. With engaging beats, heavier than its predecessor, The Fame Monster can ensure their quality and still provide something new to the repertoire of Lady Gaga. As for the retro tracks, marked here by "Speechless" and "Dance In The Dark", can have a higher quality than those of its predecessor. With seven tracks hair-raising, we can't even be discouraged by the annoying repetition of "Teeth".
FANTASTIC ALBUM. Truly not a bad song on it. Most underrated song has to be Dance In The Dark, should have been the 2nd single instead of Alejandro!!!!
I remember hearing Alejandro for the first time... it was the most beautiful thing that i have ever heard back then, the sound of it, the melody...oh... and this emotion carries throughout the whole album for me. The songs are all individuals on their own, strong, independant songs, pop masterpieces. Bad Romance is one of the best songs ever, it is trully unique and special... i could go on writing about this album forever, but i will just say, 5/7 :D
The simplest masterpeice album i have ever heard .
Com certeza esse álbum foi um dos melhores que o pop teve prazer em conhecer, peca um pouco na profundidade das letras, mas mesmo assim, Lady Gaga com apenas 1 ano de estouro, traz inúmeras insinuações e metáforas. Com uma música de abertura PERFEITA, que junta criatividade, vocais, efeitos e até marketing em uma música só, Bad Romance é digno de um 11, sozinha. Dance in the Dark, um pop marcado pela influência das outras décadas, indicado ao Grammy, uma das maiores faixas do álbum. Lady Gaga mesmo arriscando em Teeth, ainda deixa com aquela sensação gostosa. Muito bom, muito 10!!!
An EP full of amazing tracks. Dance in the dark is THE SONG on this record.MY TOP 51. Dance In The Dark2. Monster3. Alejandro4. Bad Romance5. So happy I could die
This album is legendary. This is Gaga how we like. Wacky, fun and absolutely potty-mouthed. This album has attitude and lets you embrace your inner freak. #LongLiveGaga
Fresh in a moment of boring and repetitive music industry, she reinvented pop again
La Biblia del Pop! El mejor álbum de Lady Gaga. No tengo canción favorita, me gustan todas las canciones de este álbum. Icónica!! ❤
This EP is very good: it's cohesive, it's dark, and it has good concept - Gaga's fears.
The Fame Monster is the perfect album to spend your time in club or just to hang out somewhere. But I like this album for its conception. It's really wonderful how Gaga tells us about dark fame.
7 out of 8 melodic and catchy compositions, 3 long-term hits. This album is almost perfect.
Much better than Lady Gaga's first album, 'The Fame Monster' manages where the first one fails: focus. It is much more focused on what Gaga is really about: good beats, interesting lyrics and just good music to dance to and enjoy oneself. After seeing the videos, too, it just all fits in perfectly. Basically, all of the songs are very good and they are all feel related somehow, even the stand-out ballad "Speechless" which is Gaga's first really good ballad.Also, her cooperation with Beyonce is noteworthy in 'Telephone,' which is one of my favourite dance tracks ever. Definitely, a much better album than 'The Fame' and an excellent 2nd album for Gaga. If she keeps this up, we're in for a treat when the next album comes out! Good work!!! Rah rah ah ah ah Roma, roma ma, Gaga ooh la la. :)
Another blockbuster album by Lady Gaga. Bad Romance is the best song off the record. Bad Romance is just spectacular in every way. The song "Monster" is a close second. Each song is well written and produced.
A nice album. My only complaint is her ballads, because I believe her voice is more suited to dance/pop songs. She's the only decent pop star today, and the only one trying out new things, as Michael Jackson and Madonna did back in the 80s (though I wouldn't say Gaga is as good as them). Way better than Bieber, Swift, or Kesha.
Lady Gaga has just slayed the pop history with a 8-track EP.This EP is life !The theme ''monster'' has became a trend + the singles are still gaining spins on the radio.Totally a pop classic and this will be remembered after 20 years.The lead single Bad Romance is just a masterpiece on its own , in fact the song crashed the charts and award ceremonies last year.Alejandro is ''latin-insprided pop song'' but the instrumental is just amazing!The 3rd song on the album ''Monster'' explains all those bloody-monster theme + the beats and the lines are amazing.Speechless is the only ballad in the album.To be honest that is the greatest ballad-pop song i've ever listened in 5 years.Fernando produced Dance in the Dark is the best song on the EP.The lines , the beats - da da da dance vocals ~ Everything on that song is just perfect.Telephone (feat. BeyoncÃ©) has already shown as the best collabration in 5 years by critics and award shows.So Happy I Could Die is more down-tempo chill pop song but still great.Teeth is like the wackiest thing on that album but it completes the whole era , the theme.Lady Gaga did a great job with this album - Totally worth buying.
Amazing. Fans will love it and people that hate her will hate it. But if you listen without bias and you like pop music then you will fall in love.
On;y criticism is that its too short. This album explores deeper themes than The ame and boasts catchy numbers like Bad Romance and Telephone. The lone ballad Speechless shows a side to Gaga that most people wouldn't have expected.
A solid album with each song bringing substance to the album as a whole. Lady Gaga is truly a great musical artist. Whether you like her outrageous outfits and interesting personality, her artistry is absolutely amazing. Other than "Bad Romance" and "Dance in the Dark", none of these songs capture Gaga's talent. Most of the songs are actually just general electropop in the mainstream world, just with clever infectious melodies and choruses to make them stand out. However, Gaga is just starting her career, and these songs, though not timeless, are a great start for her soon-to-be gigantic career.
Pop phenomenon Lady Gaga does it again. Not only does she provide love-filled songs, but opposite of "The Fame", she talks about the dark side of fame. "The Fame Monster" is an addition to The Fame era. With 8 brand-new tracks, each one is about Lady Gaga's "fear monsters". She also proves that she can run over any artist in the industry with the singles including "Telephone feat. Beyonce", "Bad Romance" and "Alejandro". Some songs will make you want to cry, including "Speechless" and "So Happy I Could Die". Many are club-friendly.
OMG!!!!! My favorite album ever!!!!! "Dance in the Dark" is the best song on the album. The album shows a different side of gaga. "Speechless" is a song that usually makes me cry because of the ontent and how heartfelt it is...GAGA WILL NEVER BE TOPPED
The darker side of Gaga is definetly compelling but lacked in depth, but she sure knows how to crank up tunes that most pop stars can only dream of. With standouts like 'Telephone', 'Bad Romance' and 'Teeth', this album will please both new and old fans. Now ... let's redefine the length of a 'studio album' shall we?!
She out-did herself!!
I love her work, it's so marvelous. She continues her work wonderfully and this is even better that The Fame. She's getting better day by day. I can't even pick a favorite song on this album, I love them all!
This is my favorite album. The best dance/electronic album ever made. It has catchy dance club songs (Bad Romance, Alejandro, Telephone), so as deep lyrics (Speechless, Dance In The Dark).
The Fame Monster by Lady GaGa is an example of how Pop music should be. Each song is different from the last and shows that she does all sorts of music well. 8 great new songs as well as a CD with all songs from her debut album "The Fame" as well. A definite buy for near anyone.
Perfection. lady gaga inspires new things on the fame. her music is much richer. you can tell shes grown as an artist over the past year that she rose to fame. this is an amazing album!
Ultra-catchy hooks, dancefloor anthems, solid production and solid water-tight lyrics can be heard throughout the entirety of "The Fame Monster". The one and only flaw with the record, besides the incredbly short length, is that some of the songs sound a tab bit samey to Monster's predecessor "The Fame" for instance the lead single "Bad Romance" sounds like a re-upped version of GaGa's hit single "Poker Face" But Lady GaGa does show the listeners that she is evolving her signature euro-dance-pop style with tracks like the more urban track "Telephone" with Beyonce, the crazy romping sexually driven "Teeth" or the 70's rock derived ballad "Speechless. Monster is definitely a great listen and has many potential future singles on it!
The only reason this album did not get a ten, is i'm not sure about the track "Teeth". It's too all over the place. Otherwise, this album is AMAZING. Every other song, including the extra song "No Way". "Monster" is an amazingly catchy club-banger... I cannot stop listening to it ."Telephone" is the perfect collaboration between two pop-icons. Love "Dance in the Dark" and "So Happy I Could Die". "Alejandro" and "Bad Romance" are equally amazing. Also, "Speechless" is Gaga's best ballad, yet. She proves to everyone that she truly can sing--very well. It's got lovely lyrics and is one of my favorites of the album. This is a must buy!
PERFECT. She's a genius and stands out from the rest. Creates songs that are radio worthy and artistic. And she can sing. The song "Monster" is my favorite and "Dance in the Dark" is the most creative. "Telephone" is catchy and "So Happy I Could Die" is addicting. Her voice sounds incredible on "Speechless" and "Alejandro" has an awesome beat. Buy it !
Amazing album that completes The Fame era, Telephone will be the Poker Face of the album and a worldwide #1 success. Dance in the Dark is Marilyn Manson meets Madonna. 7/8 songs are truly worthy of being singles and add to Lady Gaga's talent.
Yes, she is a Madonna rip-off, but Maddie had it easier with the shock factor and music back in the 80s. I think both The Fame and Monster are great, the latter actually sounds like a pre-Fame recording. I mean, the girl can write and sing.
Strange how most reviews seem to praise Gaga yet none give the album a higher score than 80. The Fame slowly became a near perfect album for me and The Fame Monster, albeit very different in sound, mood and character, sounds extremely infectious and has some genuine gem moments. The girl is a pop genius and i pity those who say she is merely a copy of Madonna or whatever cause that is pure BS.
A very worthy album; Here she evolves into a self aware celebrity, exploring the darker side of the Fame while incorporating new styles of music into the equation. On the surface she's just another pop star, but underneath all that, when you listen closely to the lyrics - particularly in "Speechless", and 'Dance in the Dark", you will find the talented Lady behind the GaGa. There are 8 songs on this album, and none are bad. Highly recommended to listen to, and buy.
Fantastic followup to the Fame. Several different styles and influences represented from gothic to 80s dance, from Bowie and Queen to ABBA and Madonna. Standout tracks include: Bad Romance, Monster, Telephone and Dance in the Dark.
Lady gaga keeps it coming with 8 amazing new songs, each different, as well as catchy. they are also based on severeral different "monsters" she discovered while on tour. telephone is, by far, the most catchy song, followed by Bad romance and speechless. Overall, the album is worth the 8 dollars on itunes.
More ambitious than her first album, Can't wait what's in store for us next.
This is actually better than her previous album. I can see what she is doing, "The Fame" was about the good things she expected about being famous, her aspirations to become famous etc. and "The Fame Monster" was about the bad things about fame which happened to her after becoming famous; every rose has its thorn :PThe lead single, "Bad Romance", followed by other awesome tracks such as "Alejandro", "Monster", "Dance in The Dark" are all catchy and fit the album very well. This album has changed the mindsets of some of the people who bashed on her previous album, it even turned her haters into her fans, albeit, some people are still incorrigible and will hate mainstream music regardless.
So much more creative than her debut album, The Fame Monster is a masterful 2nd album. My personal favourite is 'Dance in The Dark'. An eery dance track which has a large madonna influence. 'Bad Romance' signals a change of emphasis to darker themes and sounds. This album sees Gaga expand and improve on the Fame. It's the best pop for a while and leads me to be excited by what her 2011 album might promise.
I don't need to say much, this is a highly enjoyable album and those that hate it are just haters with nothing to do. Bad Romance, Telephone, Alejandro, Monster, Dance In The Dark and Teeth are awesome, Speechless proves that Lady Gaga just isn't suitable to sing ballad and So Happy I Could Die is... well, disposable. What I love about her is her freshness, her creativity to create insanely catchy hooks and surprisingly good lyrics. Those that dismiss her as just another pop act are clearly mistaken,cause she will be her... for a really long time.
This is much more of what I was expecting from an artist even much higher above cookie-cutter-pop-stuff. This album shows a different and more intimate side of Lady Gaga than ever before, especially in her debut album, The Fame. "Dance in the Dark", & "Telephone" are amazing. The rest are also very good. This will probably be one of the best albums the Fame Monster will ever make.
This album is one of those rare cases where popularity and fame ACTUALLY helps a music artist. While some songs defianitly outshine others, every song is at least worth a 5th or 6th listen on your iPod.
I loved this album soo much, my favourite song on the album has to be teeth, it has such a dirty beat that makes everyone want to get up and march! The whole album has an creepy, eery aura, completely different to that of The Fame
"The Fame Monster" is GaGa's best work yet. "The Fame" really helped her to become a worldwide superstar, but it was "The Fame Monster" that established her as a pop artist. From "Bad Romance" to "Teeth" this is one of the greatest pop music creations I had heard in a long time. The dark, electronic beats , the self-written lyrics, the meaning of each song ("the eight fears")... everything fits perfectly into her concept and it will probably be the standout of her career, the moment were she is the most successful singer of the world, and the moment were her music is liked the most. The album features some of the best RedOne productions yet (and judging by his later works, I think they will keep that title), and one of the most special GaGa songs: Dance in the Dark. I don't think this song would've been very successful, but it is very unique, and has a very beautiful message. "Bad Romance" is probably the most iconic and successful GaGa song, and Speechless shows that she can also make ballads, even if they are on a GaGa way. I think she is capable of topping this album, but we will have to wait and see, as she doesn't seem to be willing to repeat herself. Maybe with a different sound, but I just hope she delivers this level of quality again.Highlights: Bad Romance, Dance in the Dark, Speechless
Overall, the E.P is really strong and the standouts are the 3 singles: Bad Romance, Telephone, Alejandro and Monster. The only 2 tracks I find a bit below my expectations are Teeth and Dance In The Dark. Overall, The Fame Monster is enjoyable and is a great follow up to The Fame.
This is a great album with some great vocals.
Lady GaGa is by far the most creative, inventive artist in pop culture today. She has found a way to reinvent pop music and make it interesting again. I LOVE her.
An impressive, creative, original piece of work. There may be only 8 songs, but I think they're ALL brilliant - especially Bad Romance, Monster, and Dance In The Dark. Good work, GaGa!
Lady Gaga has more quality material on this album than many pop stars who have come out the past five years, she has a star quality and a raw talent in vocals and songwriting which can compare to Pop Royals Madonna and the late Michael Jackson with an artistic flare not seen since brit Art-Rock star Kate Bush! The Fame Monster boasts sheer brilliance with 8 sensationally epic songs including-Bad Romance,Dance In the dark,Teeth,Telephone,Monster,So Happy I Could Die,Alejandro and the epic rock ballad SPEECHLESS! one of the best albums of the decade from a star in the making!
I don't want to start off by saying it is the best album ever, but it is. I can listen to The Fame (also an amazing album) and into The Fame Monster loving every song. While The Fame Monster addition has a different feel than The Fame release, I like it's difference and oddness. The entire track list is fun and amazing. I'd like to mention that I have seen adverseness toward "Teeth", while I would have agreed in the beginning; it grew on me., and now I love the song. Its weird but hard and different making it a great track. "Telephone" is my number one song off the album, while they are all great. Hope she can keep up the great work and keep the hits coming with "Born This Way", regardless of the public, her fans will love it.
This album includes the great pop beat songs from the fame but also incorporates the more rich tracks like Teeth ,Monster ,So happy I could DIe and even her own ballad Speechless.
I do enjoy and love dance music, so naturally, Lady Gaga is a guilty pleasure of mine. Her music easily lights up any club it is played in; however, it is nothing groundbreaking. She has quite a unique public persona and crafts well-executed and functional dance music. Her music does not push any sort of boundaries, though; in fact, there are more talented electronic acts, the only difference being that they have not be absorbed into the mainstream music culture. I did enjoy this ep and repeat it a lot throughout the year; however, with all the other outstanding releases throughout the year--Phoenix, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Royksopp, Girls, Mastodon, The xx, Animal Collective, Grizzly Bear, Neko Case, Sonic Youth, Bat for Lashes, Assemblage 23, Angelspit, Rotersand, Rammstein, just to name a few--it is quite difficult for me to say this is even remotely close to being one of the best releases of the year. If you are a Lady Gaga fan like I am, then you already know what to expect and probably purchased it the week it came out like I did. The ep does feature a few standout and memorable tracks; "Bad Romance," with its Hitchcockian theme, and "Telephone," with its appearance by Beyonce and four-on-the-floor beats.
There are some amazing songs on this album. Dance in the dark, bad romance and monster. Not to mention telephone. also there's the rather strange tune of allejadro overall i'd give it a 10 but is't just lacking the wow factor.
Lady Gaga infuses the synthpop magnetism that made "The Fame" such a hit with gothic inspired beats and darker themes. The result is a half-hearted attempt by Gaga to be an even more distraught poetic. While this new found allure works in some cases ("Telephone" "Dance in the Dark"), it mostly results in mediocrity. Gaga is still pretty weak when it comes to ballads and "Speeches" feels like a inadequate reach by the artist. Gaga is certainly not threading to new directions, but her dance-pop machinations are less flavorful than "The Fame" and more mechanical. Over all, while The Famous Monster intrigues, it doesn't reach up to it's monstrous intentions. ALBUM HIGHLIGHTS: Telephone, Dance in the Dark The So-So: Bad Romance, Alejandro, Speechless, Teeth ALBUM DUDS: So Happy I Can Die, Monster.
Good follow-up to The Fame but she should have added more tracks and released it as her second album. The standouts are Dance in the Dark and Telephone which pairs her with Beyonce. There is definitely a darker theme here. Speechless fails to show her soft side and Teeth is a letdown. Otherwise, a solid mini-album for Lady Gaga. Listen to: Dance in the Dark Skip: Speechless
Is a very good album, all the songs would be singles in an album of another artist. The best songs are Telephone and Dance in the Dark. However, all songs are great, there are only two somewhat weak: Teeth and So Happy I Could Die. But the best thing of the album is that Gaga just doesn't know to do dance and electronic songs. Speechless is by far, the best ballad of the year. Is a great album that, if you like pop, you should buy.
One of the best if not at times the most highly overrated EP released in recent years. It is an incredible piece of pop music, that will certainly leave many, dare I say it, speechless.
O melhor álbum da mulher que conseguiu dominar o mundo tão rapidamente. Incrível como ela conseguiu produzir algo tão grandioso. The Fame Monster marcará gerações.
Para ser una expansión de The Fame, suena más a una expansión o introducción a Born This Way.
A beautiful album by Lady Gaga, it's even better than the first one. Queen of po
Well, Lady Gaga achieved the titular Fame of her first album... now it's time for the obligatory album about how fame's not all it's cracked up to be. And while almost all of the songs are a superficial pleasure, the tragedy is just how much wasted talent there is. This is a woman who could be making intellectually as well as superficially satisfying albums- Dance in the Dark hints at this. But songs like "So Happy I Could Die" are truly disappointing, as there is really nothing of note about them aside from the chorus. Gaga is obviously desperate for lyrics- the entire album can be basically summed up as: SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX. The very worst song on the album is "Monster." She has a guy doing guest vocals to fawn over her and talk about how wonderful she is. It's really horrible.The very best song, on the other hand, is "Bad Romance." It's bombastic, catchy, and gothic. A lot of fun to listen to.Gaga has talent and quirkiness going for her, but it'll be a while before she makes an album with real depth. There is, of course, no denying that this album is fun to listen to, and that it's a lot better than anything by Katy Perry or Ke$ha. If we have to have some kind of commercialized pop, then The Fame Monster is better than most. In fact, it's quite possibly the best commercialized pop of the year.
The worst thing to happen to music over the last decade.
I just reviewed The Fame, which is better in my opinion, this "album" isn't a step forward at all. The abrupt change in music style is too quick and too random at the time she released it. The album has way too little tracks, and most of the songs are depressing and I don't get how her voice went from clear and high, to low and raspy. It just doesn't make sense. and Teeth is the dumbest song I ever heard. Okay, not the dumbest, but the third dumbest.Bad Romance - 7/10Alejandro - 7/10Monster - 5/10Speechless - 3/10 (ballads are her weak point)Dance In The Dark - 6/10 9makes her look like a satanist)Telephone - 9/10So Happy I Could Die - 8/10Teeth - 1/10 (It's really THAT bad!!!!)
Better than "Born This Way", but still a nonsense album. "Speechless" is a great track, but "Alejandro", "Telephone" and "Teeth" seem to be jokes, not songs.
Semi-catchy dance beats set to bland and soulless lyrics. Certainly good for a random teenage girl's myspace page, but severely lacking in content.
None of the new songs are as instantly catchy as the songs on the first album, and I'm not sure I expect any of them to be added to my regular play list.
YUCK! the WHOLE EP has only 3 gd songs, Bad Romance, Monster And So Happy i could die... A big disappointment, but it's actually better than The Fame, too much about sex and is too creepy!
A little better then debut but we are still at a rather low level.A generic collection of pieces electropo and dance-pop that will last a season or two. no ambition, very little originality.Overrated and disposable.
This "supplementary" album only offers a few magical enhancements from her debut album but it has far to many misses to be a good album. "Alejandro" sounds like a bad Ace of Base track, "Telephone" is annoying, and "monster" attempts to be sexually assertive but kind of fizzles to unimpressiveness. Surely "Bad Romance" is a solid cut but I believe that song is upstaged by the gritty fun of "Teeth". Sure, she seems to have fun with this album but it is easy to see the early signs of her spiral from singer to attention seeker.
Mindless lyrics and repetitive beats. This album was crap, thats all there is to it. It was a trashy pop album from the worlds biggest attention whore.
I bought the first album on a whim because I liked the first single but I didn't buy this album, listened to it on the internet and it's definitely one of the worst albums I have heard.
While most people are going Gaga on this EP, i must admit that i was a bit disappointed on this EP. The tracks are too long with sick beats and hooks. Although, the songs are really good but it did not satisfy me like what her debut did. Her voice is not good but she can sing. The EP is artistic but she is better in the futuristic one.
Funny that it was given a 3 elsewhere on here. Only a few listens and it's totally magnetic. Bad Romance is possibly her best song to date - the point where the chorus kicks in just takes my breath away. That and the hypnotic Abba'esque Alejandro, make this worth the price alone.Maybe some are out-takes, but man. this is is just stunning!
Her first album was nothing more than Gaga capitalizing on a sound that had been popular in Europe for ages. She does the same thing with The Fame Monster, except she reaches back a little further, and a little more underground, and comes up with a sound that still isn't original, but is definitely more mature. There is nothing groundbreaking about this album but it's a short, sweet collection of some great industrial pop music.
Com 8 faixas, o LP "The Fame Monster" seria inicialmente apenas o relançamento de uma edição de luxo do seu bem sucedido "The Fame", mas desde o início Lady Gaga fez questão que o trabalho fosse levado como o seu segundo disco de estúdio. Com pouco mais de 30 minutos de duração, Gaga consegue usar o tempo a seu favor, fazendo deste trabalho um disco com muito mais coesão e a concisão acaba por ser um elemento que a impede de tropeçar dentro de clichês do gênero.Com letras feitas para dominar as pistas e um dance pop conceitual influenciado nitidamente por gigantes como Madonna, Prince, Michael Jackson e David Bowie, Lady Gaga aqui traz letras pessoais e passagens sobre moda e o esteriótipo da fama como algo atroz. A artista que chegou na música pop em meados de 2008 e em 2009 dominava tudo como um furação, tem aqui em seu ápice o despertar, mesmo que em primeiro momento em incerteza e desdém, de o nascimento de uma estrela tão extravagante quanto os seus looks feitos pelo "Haus of Gaga". Com muito mais poder criativo e visão artística que qualquer concorrente da época, ela podia até dividir os charts com as mesmas, mas era de longe a artista mais influente e marcante do pop de sua geração.Mesmo que acusada por alguns de copiar o estilo de alguma das estrelas anteriormente citadas, Gaga tem em "The Fame Monster" o poder de intrigar e de unir com o seu produtor RedOne um som bastante original pra época e manter o lado visual do pop que estava apagado há algum tempo (exemplo disso são seus videoclipes que excedem a barreira comum da época dos 3 ou 4 minutos).O EP funciona praticamente bem por inteiro e tudo soaria facilmente como um potencial hit número #1 das paradas. Os destaques ficam pela ótima "Bad Romance" que engole todos os singles de trabalho do "The Fame", além de "Speechless" inspirada pelo rock de seus ídolos Bowie e Queen, "Dance in the Dark" inspirada por "Vogue" da Madonna e "Telephone" que contém a participação muito bem colocada de Beyoncé.
Cant enjoy the songs as i wished i wanted to. I liked a couple songs but as a whole album together, it fell quite flat and short for me. I dont understand the praise for this album.
This iconic extended play is Gaga's best album as a solo artist, and it will be very hard for her to top this one. (I haven't listened to Cheek to Cheek or the A Star Is Born soundtrack.) I have decided to review this album over ten years after its release date because Chromatica is scheduled to release this month. I had the privilege of attending the Washington, DC show of The Monster Ball Tour and it was electrifying. The only dud on the album is "Speechless", which is the only reason I can't give this album a perfect score.
Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference...
Bad Romance (8/10)Alejandro (5/10)Monster (6/10)Speechlees (7/10)Dance In The Dark (0/10)Telephone (7/10)So Happy I Could Die (10/10)Teeth (4/10)
Se puede ver la falta de capacidad de esta mujer, queriendo inovar algo pero solo suena a exito pasajero que en unos años nadie reconocera.Es 0 recomendable, escuchelo bajo su responsabilidad
the purpose of a reissue is to improve something that was already done and although it is not a big difference with The Fame, definitely gaga redeemed and won a very high place in Pop and in our hearts.
A segunda parte da copia, as vitimas foram David Bowie, Cher, Prince e Madonna, eternamente redutiva.
Com exceção de" Speachless" e "Dance In The Dark" todo o resto é descartável. Típico Pop comercial e genérico que enlouquece adolescentes vazios e sem senso crítico. A mulher tem uma boa voz desperdiçada com toda essa produção cheia de sintetizadores e autotune.
Urge retiro de la copia barata de Madonna. Qué horror con esta inventada. Nadie se acuerda de ella en 2020.
It's a good album actually, but I can't say the same about Gaga fans on the other hand, they are trash :)
fadga
Músicas de mau gosto e totalmente aleatórias! As poucas que são boas foram copiadas da Madonna!
Only after being overwhelmed by the sheer visibility of her warp-speed relaunch did I realize how enjoyable and inescapable her hooks and snatches had turned out to be.
Pop masterpiece Pop masterpiece Pop masterpiece Pop masterpiece Pop masterpiece Pop masterpiece
Lady Gaga's finest moment as a recording artist thus far. The eclecticism Gaga shows on this superb EP really does give her a sense of credibility as a pop artist, enabling herself to go from powerful, heart-broken rock ballads like 'Speechless', back to her more "traditional" dance tracks like 'Dance in the Dark', all the way out to tracks like 'Alejandro' that give Gaga a sense of relatable vulnerability. Lovely.
Dance In The Dark and Telephone keep this EP from falling on its head with dud's like Alejandro and So Happy I Could Die. Bad Romance is an example of what Lady Gaga does best - lets the music speak and actually shuts up a bit.
Love this album. Gaga is amazing. Only eight songs but all eight songs are hit songs. Amazing song writing on all songs. Track by track you don't get tired of it. One of the best EP album. The Fame was an amazing album and she came back with the Fame Monster another hitmaker album. Her style from the fame change but still and electro pop rock album.
Whether you're a fan of GaGa's "very" crazy lifestyle or not, you gotta note the girl's creativity. The Fame Monster is not God's gift to pop music, but it certainly is one of the genre's most flattering attempts. "Bad Romance" is the album's highly addictive lead single that heavily borrows from gothic industrial. "Alejandro", "Monster", and "Dance in the Dark" are no doubt, some of the greatest entries in GaGa's career. "Speechless" is a bit overrated, but it is definitely a flattering power ballad that spotlights GaGa's powerful vocal chords and piano skills. "So Happy I Could Die" and "Teeth" are the album's weaker tracks, being less creative than the previous tracks. So while The Fame Monster is not the greatest pop album, it certainly gives us an idea of who Lady GaGa exactly is, and keeps us interested in what's coming next.
The Fame Monster isn't perfect, but it's arguably one of the finest pop albums in recent years. It's certainly more handsomely produced, varied, and even darker than The Fame; influences ranging between '80s dance pop to Gothic industrial. Every track has its own unique twists and are undeniably catchy at that. Its standout tracks are "Bad Romance" and "Dance In The Dark", which both heavily rely on industrial. However, its weakest track is its outro, "Teeth", which is just dull and uninspiring altogether, unlike the rest of the tracks.
Lady Gaga's surprisingly quick ascent to the top of the pop charts was followed shortly thereafter with the release of "The Fame Monster" an EP that is sold as a standalone 8-track CD or in the Deluxe version which packs in the original "The Fame" album.The whole point of this album, as Gaga explained it, was to address her fears. With that in mind, it's a wonder that the album is overall very upbeat and dance-oriented. A fear of being in love fashions itself into the killer lead single, "Bad Romance", while fears of sex and abuse manifested into "Alejandro" and the Eurodisco sounds of "Dance in the Dark", respectively. Produced and co-written almost exclusively with RedOne, the tracks focus more on synths and programmed instruments than the last album did. However, fans of the older sound are in for a treat when it comes to "Speechless". Gaga wrote this track for her father to convince him to get an open-heart surgery, and she wrote it as a fear of losing the one she loves to the cruel fate of death."The Fame Monster" does a decent job of eliminating what might be considered filler material, but that doesn't stop "Teeth" from awkwardly Southern-foot-stomping the album to a hault with its repetitive strums and melody-lacking lyrics.Overall, it's a welcome addition to "The Fame" although having a few more tracks (and axing "Teeth") would have made it all the more welcome.
This is better than her first album. The songs in this album has impact, which I want to have in her songs. The songs are very catchy just like her first album. A great album, overall.
This is Gaga's best album to date. Other than "Monster", which is poorly written, and "Speechless", which is just simply boring, every song is a winner. "Alejandro" became my favorite song of hers the first time I heard it, before it was even announced as a single.
I am a Lady Gaga fan and I enjoyed this album. But, there could of been more songs on there. It only takes about a little less than twenty minutes to listen to all the songs. And sometimes I feel disapointed because a lot of her lyrics are just dark profanity.
You could look at THE FAME MONSTER as an extended re-do of Gaga's debut THE FAME or an entirely stand-alone extended play. Either way, it's Lady Gaga's best work yet.
Here we see Lady Gaga in new light as opposed to "The Fame". Where "The Fame" highlighted on a fun, pop sound. "The Fame Monster" EP gives a new perspective on the reality of "The Fame". Drawing inspirations from different styles and melodies, she reminds us that not all catchy music has to be cliche. Lyrically, the EP has a grotesque atmosphere that combines well with the darker tone while keeping an attractive sound. Where at a few points it may lack depth, it still triumphs over many other modern pop sensations.
Um dos melhores albuns pop da história sem dúvidas, brilhante, extremamente bem produzido e escrito, é um resumo completo do por quê Lady Gaga é a melhor e mais talentosa de sua geração, destaque para: Bad Romance, Speechless, Monster e Dance in The Dark
The best thing about this is that it sounds like the fame. 5 out of the 8 tracks follow in bad romance's footsteps in being danceable and addictive. Dance in the dark is ok but the other two, speech and teeth are rubbish in my opinion but I suppose they are right up the 'little monsters' street. If you loved the fame then you will love this. Another great record from Gaga.
This album sounds great and is good! It's not innovative or revolutionary, but is good and fresh.Speechless and So Happy I Could Die are great! The best of Lady gaga
I liked this album a lot more than her first one, the only big complaint I have is I wish she would've have put more songs on this album. I felt it was way too short. Again, she made great dance/pop songs. No other complaints.
A great follow-up to The Fame, Gaga has improved everything that was wrong with the first album. The popcorn songs were exchanged for still catchy tunes but with more meaningful lyrics and somber tones, instead of wasting time riding disco sticks and repeating over and over again "Paparazzi".The 8 additional songs to The Fame do not exactly engage perfectly with the previous album, but it is amaziing to see how much the artist developed. The songs aren't exactly lyrical or musical gems (Just dancing tunes with lots of 80s remixes, notable in the song "Dance In The Dark", the best of the bunch) but are definite improvements. "Bad Romance" is an instant classic, "Alejandro" a fun twisted version of Abba's "Fernando", "Monster" an eclectic love song, "Speechless" a Nancy Sinatra homage that works perfectly, "Telephone" an amazing collaboration with Beyoncé (Less exotic but more rythmic than "Video Phone"), and the last two songs, "So Happy I Could Die" and "Teeth" fit perfectly as creepy, disgusting and fantastic songs.An improvement, for sure. An album so dark with so many layers of techno-infused pop nostalgia that you are forced to listen again and again, besides its short duration.
Yo compre este album y bueno es menor que su antecesor , pero combina muy bien los sonidos electro, rock y pop. Ademas su contenido lirico de te ha entender los miedos de Gaga y el amor por su musica.
Lady Gaga returned with her first and Grammy-winning extended play containing hit songs such as "Bad Romance," "Telephone" and "Alejandro." Clearly one of the best EP's I've ever listened to.
Beginning with the Gothic industrial dance-pop camp known worldwide as "Bad Romance" ("You and me could write a Bad Romance") and ending with the blasphemous combination of gospel music and S&M-styled double entendre of "Teeth", The Fame Monster has Gaga at her most comfortable: glam pop + lyricism so fool of itself, it's genius ("And in the silence of the night/Through all the tears/And all the lies/I touch myself and it's alright"). Though it's no Like a Prayer by any means or measure, Lady Gaga settles her bare feet in the sands of a moody mixture of electropop and '80s vintage darkwave decorated with half-smart lyricism -- Mother Monster herself describes each song as having its own 'Monster' metaphor for the dark side of fame.Besides highlights such as its lead single, the Queen B-featured earworm of a second single "Telephone", and the underrated dance-pop masterpiece "Dance in the Dark", which has a word spoken verse that pays respect to everyone from Judy Garland to Jesus Christ, The Fame Monster overall had the opportunity of having a hit on 7 out of the 8 songs on the EP/mini-album (something tells me "Teeth" wouldn't stand a chance at making it to any radio friendly charts. In my opinion, Born This Way is sonically her greatest album to date, however, The Fame Monster could stand as her safest and most iconic.
Changing the game with each album. Definitely a darker side to The Fame as what she have described. The Album perfectly comply the title THE FAME MONSTER. It would be difficult to understand in first listen but if we venture into lyrics and the order of the song, the album is near perfection. Just a small step
Gaga brings out her dark side in "The Fame Monster". The album feature lush and well produced tracks and collaborations. Despite this only being an EP, the quality of each song makes it a fully realized album.
Lady Gaga is no cookie cutter plastic pop star in the likes that mainstream is so used to seeing. Her image is edgy and the music on this album is heavy brilliant innovative pop with dark lyrics and powerful messages. Whether at a party or a club, one can't ignore how fast dance floors fill when Gaga's songs come on, but the thing that I love the most about these powerful dance floor anthems are the thought process and the meanings behind them.
Gaga improved with this album since her debut moment. "The Fame Monster" certainly reflects the dark side of fame without making it be nasty. Most recommended songs are "Bad Romance", "Alejandro" and "Dance In The Dark".
The Fame Monster é um dos melhores EPs que já existiram. As melodias e as letras são excelentes, tanto que um EP fez um sucesso enorme. É muito criativo e divertido, com músicas que vão ser lembradas para toda a história da música Pop.
Top quality Pop music. Dark and gritty. Standouts: Dance In The Dark, Bad Romance and Alejandro.
This album is thirty-five minutes of sheer pop perfection. Dark, original, catchy, and inventive, The Fame Monster was Lady Gaga at her absolute best.
Track by track review:1. Bad Romance 8.5/102. Alejandro 10/103. Monster 10/104. Speechless 4/105. Dance in the Dark 0.5/106. Telephone 6/107. So Happy I Could Die 10/108. Teeth 10/10Highlights: So Happy I Could Die, Monster, Teeth, Alejandro, Bad Romance.Potential singles: Bad Romance, Dance in the Dark, Monster, Telephone.
As radio is still spinning "Paparazzi" from The Fame (2008), The Fame Monster released in Oct. 2009, is another step for Gaga towards super-stardom. On this album, shows a very dark side of Gaga we did not know with the opening of the big hit "Bad Romance". Overall combined with The Fame, it is one of the best albums of All time! Other than "Bad Romance", standout tracks include "Alejandro", "Telephone", "Dance in the Dark", "So Happy I Could Die", "Monster" and "Teeth".
Easily Lady Gaga's best album. Lady Gaga was way more artistic on this album than she was on The Fame. The production is more creative and Lady Gaga's artistic side is shown more. The lyrics have also improved greatly. This album is an overall B+. Highlights: "Monster", "Telephone", "Dance in the Dark". Worst song: "Alejandro"
A qualidade do álbum é inegável. O som está totalmente diferente do álbum debut ''The Fame(que é mais puxado para o lado POP/ELETRÔNICO)''. Aqui, em TFM, experimentamos um som mais pop, Gaga inovou na produção das músicas tanto quanto na letra das mesmas.Explorando seus maiores medos, Gaga conseguiu criar um dos álbuns mais relevantes da década.BEST SONGS: Alejandro, Telephone, So Happy I Could Die
Nostalgic. Sensational. A whole generation was marked by this songs, we we're afraid of watching Bad Romance's music video, but we loved the song and its catchy chorus. Alejandro's dark video and subliminal lyrics fulfilled with mystery. Telephone's crazy and non-sense video, featuring Beyoncé, cliche lyrics about the dance floor, in a Gaga style, with amazing vocals (with Auto-tune to give that sense of a telephone glitch). This is her best album, exploring fears from Lady Gaga's perspective, an Underground-Dark-Synth-Pop album that is the opposite from her first album, from a lyrical perspective.
Dance in the Dark, Bad Romance and So Happy I Could Die are great pop songs, they carry this EP.The rest of it is just okay, nothing outstanding, just generic pop music with generic lyrics.
No doubt it is a good job. Gaga I managed to follow the quality that I leave you with The Fame, the only downside of this album is that half of the songs are quite commercial and its quality is very loose but very rhythmic.
One of the best pop albums of all time, and one of the best albums of the 21st century! The record really benefits from its short length, and Gaga's catchy, sometimes sad and sometimes insidious songwriting really just grabs me, as they did to many more others before. The Fame Monster is a perfect album; a pop album that is artful sans pretentiousness or filler tracks.BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW! IT IS A MUST HAVE!
this is the best Lady Gaga's record so far (Oct 2015), it is very dark with great lyrics that experiment with the monsters of fame, relationships, sex, friends, etc,.Bad Romance is a 10/10 the dark synth/electro/pop beat is amazing so is the chorus & lyricsAlejandro 8/10 dark and catchyMonster 9/10Speechless 10/10 pop/rock ballad and wow Gaga's voiceDance In the Dark 10/10 fearless & timeless song, really dark dance song should be single.Telephone 8/10 video of the decade? yeah.So Happy I Could Die 8/10 amazing beatsTeeth 8/10
This album is undoubtedly one of the best of Lady Gaga, it demonstrates how talented she is . The Fame Monster is an epic album with great songs like Bad Romance, Dance In The Dark, Alejandro and others.
It's an amazing album. A great follow up to The Fame that talks about the dark side of fame. Very cohesive, great lyricism, innovative sounds.
MELHOR ALBUM JÁ FEITO EM TODOS OS TEMPOS, GAGA RAINHA E DESTROI TODAS AS SUAS FAVS A,K,A GODDESS OF THE WORLD E SE TA ACHANO RUIM VAI OUVIR O LIXO DO TEENAGE DREAM
I love this album because of course, I am a huge fan of Lady Gaga. I love all of the songs on the album. I like "Bad Romance", "Dance in the Dark", "Telephone", "Monster", and all the other songs. I also love The Fame and Artpop.
The Fame Monster é um EP excelente. Aqui, Gaga mostra o "monstro da fama", com as 7 primeiras músicas espetaculares. A oitava aka Teeth é bem ruim, mas não distoa a qualidade do material. Provavelmente o melhor trabalho da Lady Gaga.Pontos altos: Telephone, Monster, SpechlessPonto baixo: Teeth
The Fame Monster is Gaga's best work to date, an assortment of varied pop styles paired with lyrics about figurative monsters, fame and sexuality. this mini album is a perfect representation of the zeitgeist of the beginning of the 2010s, with its fashionable beats and impressive vocals.a massive standout in Lady Gaga's career is the glam rock anthem Speechless, which has cemented Gaga's place in the pop world as a star who can both write and belt out rock anthems masterfully crafted for massive stadiums. many would say that Gaga's best songs are her eurodance-inspired ones, but this woman belongs behind a piano, with Queen-reminiscent backing instrumentals. Gaga is clearly very inspired by Queen's and David Bowie's respective glam eras, and her personality never fails to impress and dazzle even the most casual of pop listeners.we also have the standouts Dance in the Dark and Teeth, two massive bangers that successfully reveal a darkness in Gaga's tone that still hasn't quite been retouched upon in any of her later music. overall, The Fame Monster is a fabulous step-up from her earlier music, and hopefully she will return to a darker pop style soon.
Just 8 songs but everyone wonderful representing one kind of fear. Absolutely better than the first one 'The Fame'The best songs Bad Romance, Speechless, Dance In The Dark
The Pop definition on itself. The best album of the genre in this century. The songs are so catchy and the lyrics are beyond meaningful and metaphorical. Just the Hitchcock's references in the Iconic Ultra Hit Bad romance are art on words. The Fame Monster is more than worth to listen to, but enjoyable and a trip to the dark and adorable of what Pop Music can give to us. Gaga Rocks!!!
this is a bible this is a bible this is a bible this is a bible this is a bible this is a bible this is a bible this is a bible this is a bible this is a bible
One of the most innovative and impressive albums to come out in this era of music. No musician has been able to capture all our attention and impress us with such interesting lyricism and bold vocals. Bad Romance is the most popular song on the album and the best.
To this day, the endlessly catchy hooks and at times deep, cutting lyrics run effortlessly through my mind. A true modern pop classic that earned its place in music history and truly managed to define the transition of the decades into the new era.
pop perfection album!! i love gaga as artist and i think this is her best work, "bad romanc" is a atemporal song that everyone knows and its so strong!
Her second album after the "welcome to the pop" scene with The Fame. Great songs, infectious melodies, really pop music. Gaga proved she has come to stay.
The Fame Monster is Lady Gaga's best album to date. Each song is unique, the production and the writing are great and you cannot help but to sing along to these iconic hits, like Bad Romance or Telephone.Her contemporaries should take notes. This is music. This is art.
One of the best albums I have ever heard in my life with iconic singles such as Bad Romance and Telephone and overall just being amazing with a unique dark tone. Favourites include Bad Romance, Telephone, Monster, Dance In The Dark and So Happy I Could Die. The only reason I'm not giving this album a 10 is the song Teeth which I simply do not like at all.
Great album. Darker than previous one and I like it even more. Instrumentals are wonderful and lyrically is great too.
amazing,strong,quality,powerful and the fame that describes that album, hits like bad romance, alejandro,papparazi and telephone makes this a masterpiece her best album ever and so far
This album redefined pop culture forever, truly an iconic/classic timeless album & will remain one of Gaga's most critically acclaimed albums! The way she ran the industry with this album is impressing.
Gaga Reinveta el Pop con este álbum, sin duda esta chica a dejado un legado con pistas bailables las cuales te hacen experimentar un sin fin de emociones si eres admirador de la buena música pop.
The Fame Monster was the focal point in Lady Gaga's career. Bad Romance is one of the best songs in HISTORY, and it made history too when it became the first DIAMOND certified song by a female artist ever! Highlights of this album are Alejandro, Telephone, Dance In The Dark, Monster, and of course, Bad Romance. An astounding album, 10/10.
Perfect from start to finish. Gaga is the breath of fresh air the pop industry desperately needed.
A wonderful album! A wonderful artist! Every album released, his talent and his legacy growing and most respected. This only tends to grow. Each person chooses his own Queen, Lady Gaga for me is the true queen of pop.
It is a very strong album and very very good vocals. I'm in love with this album and Lady Gaga.I mean she changed the pop music standarts. She is a living legend I adore her.
The greatest album in history, all the songs are a masterpiece. Bad Romance is the millenium hit and I love it, thanks for create it, thanks for make me brave
It may be quite short, but its quality is beyond amazing!!! With songs like "Bad Romance", "Alejandro" and "So Happy I Could Die", this is one of the greatest albums of all time!
Bible of pop music.Its one of the best albums of the decade and the most crazy and soulful projects in pop music. I cant think of party without thinking about of some ofthe hits this albums has
Gaga at her peak. "Bad Romance" swept the nation for good reason. The production is a serve and the fame monster herself is perfectly content in this sound.
Not for nothing this jewel is considered a Bible of the Pop !!! With this album Gaga came to revolutionize an industry and genre that since 2006 was dying, The Fame was his coming and The Fame Monster his word.Not only the way to do Pop music, but also the message you give in songs, music videos, presentations. That's The Fame Monster, how to get back to Pop something with soul, sense, art, make it yours.
Bad Romance - 10Alejandro - 8Monster - 10Speechless - 8Dance in the Dark - 8Telephone - 9So Happy I Could Die - 7Teeth - 7score: 8,3
A beautiful album by Lady Gaga, it's even better than the first one.A beautiful album by Lady Gaga, it's even better than the first one.A beautiful album by Lady Gaga, it's even better than the first one.
Only 8 songs gave Lady Gaga her most succes album ever. Bad Romance is the most iconic song from the 00' and Telephone, the best colaboration ever. Queen
I really enjoy this album, Gaga is art, she is the best pop artist in the world.......................................................................
a masterpiece... the true QUEEN OF POP this is pop perfection so memorable!
Lo mejor del álbum es el concepto que envuelve su música; el lado oscuro de la fama. Sus letras llenas de misterio y subliminalidades hacen del disco el mejor retorno del género dark-pop que puso muy de moda Michael Jackson en los 80's. Me atrevería a decir que The Fame Monster fue el nuevo Thriller, esta vez a cargo de una artista femenina que logro adaptar el género al siglo 21.
Mucho mejor que su primer trabajo "the fame" con este album dejo en claro que seria una gran estrella
Es el mejor trabajo discográfico de Gaga, este es el álbum con el cual se ganó el respeto dentro de la industria, es su mejor era, su mejor trabajo, su mejor todo.
Every single song tells a different story, if The Fame was a great album, The Fame Monster is just amazing, specially considering Gaga´s previous success, she managed to outdo herself with this record.
um marco, icônico, atemporal, merecia aquele album of the year. speechless melhor balada da narigudinha
This album gave the face by pop at that time, The best songs and the success abounded in Gaga and this album was not the exception
Esse álbum é INCRÍVEL!! Um dos Álbuns que revolucionou o Pop!
IMPACTANTE ALBÚM POP, um dos melhores do ano de 2009. Todos as 8 músicas poderiam ser sigles. A vibe gótica, com refrãos tocantes e grudentos de pop bom! GAGA FOI PERSPICAZ NESSA!
Solid dark pop for the masses, Lady Gaga makes history with this album talking about monsters.. the fears of her life. Includes the best Pop masterpieces of this new century, her amazing voice sings deep and complex lyrics, showing shades and different states but at the same time all that things related making it consistent. The Fame Monster is a big punch to refresh pop music and leave a legacy.
The album that shot Gaga to the level of stardom she is currently most deservedly on. All of the songs tell a different story and showcase Gaga's great vocals which are even more impressive live.
Carisma, ambición y éxito. Serían tres palabras muy adecuadas para este álbum el cual está lleno de completos bombazos musicales que nos acompañaron desde 2009 hasta hoy y con los que Lady Gaga se proclamaría como una de las reinas del pop y del mundo. Quizá lo único que le falte es un poco más de cohesión con algunas canciones.
A beautiful album by Lady Gaga, it's even better than the first one. One of the most beautiful and wonderful album ever heard... I love lady gaga. This album is absolutely perfect and poetic. Dance in the dark, Bad romance, Alejandro, So happy I could die, Teeth, Monster every song of this album is a powerful mix of great things!
A perfect Pop album. Different, original and revolutionary for an era of the music industry in which the artist, especially women, needed to dominate and show their talents.
"The Fame Monster" is undoubtedly the most worldwide famous EP of all time, it contains massive hits such as the iconic "Bad Romance", "Telephone" and "Alejandro". It deserved more singles that could have benefited Gaga's career back in the day even more. This EP raised the bar to exorbitant levels!
Elsewhere on The Fame Monster, she morphs into other stars-- Freddie Mercury on "Speechless", ABBA on "Alejandro", Madonna on "Dance in the Dark", Britney Spears on "Telephone", Kylie Minogue on "Monster", and Christina Aguilera on "Teeth". Yet instead of hopelessly retro, it comes off very modern, in part because U.S. pop and hip-hop is currently drawing heavily from Europop, hi-NRG, and dance music. As a result of it, Gaga makes a great dance pop album, maybe her best yet.
Es sin duda el mejor trabajo de su carrera, inovacion,impacto,barroquismo,oscuridad, todo!!!!
This album shows Gaga's ability as a performer , she have got an amazing voice ♥
Isn't better than 'The Fame' but there are some deep feelings and a dark vibe all over the tracks.
One of the most innovative, genius and iconic pop albums of all time. Every single song from this album was enjoyable.
Este es sin duda, el álbum pop mejor elaborado de la nueva generación, arte.
The only flaw this album has it's that it is too short. Every song could have been a single. Bad Romance is the obvious highlight on the album but every song is perfect.
I spent this past week reviewing each official song in the album, and I can say with heart that nothing fails to significantly disappoint. "Bad Romance", "Telephone", and "Alejandro" have their reasons for being culturally iconic, and are my top-three picks from this album. Each song clearly has a deeper meaning than what is truly being represented through sound and lyrics — and Gaga's voice proves it.
A beautiful and amazing album, This album is better that the first one, all the songs are pure masterpieces, this is one of the best pop albums ever!!The best album that I've ever heard. gaga's best album, no flaws in every track.
Spectacular, Brilliant, Contagious and Innovative. With an even better sound mix than The Fame, Lady Gaga undoubtedly delivers one of the best pop works ever done with striking lyrics and a mix of genres that shows how multitalented this artist is.
O álbum trouxe músicas extremamente memoráveis, como Bad Romance, que serão lembrados pra sempre. Um marco na carreira da Gaga e no mundo pop, consagrando-a como uma das melhores artista dessa geração.
Gaga mostra todo seu talento como artista pop em The Fame Monster. As faixas, que conseguem unir qualidade a potencial comercial, mostram a pluralidade da música pop da cantora.
This album is the top. Bad romance is one of the best songs ever. Nothing bad about this masterpiece
For a newcomer to the pop music, this is a good album. Actually, considering the facts it's a pop masterpiece. You can't deny that. It's simple perfection. It's Lady GaGa becoming Lady GaGa. She will never be better than this, NEVER.
Such an amazing album, with so many memorable hits. Not joking when I say this is a true pop masterpiece!
one of Gaga's best work!!it showcases her vocal abilities and versatility .................
Absolute pop perfection. I used to listen to this album all the time when I was a kid and I recently did it again and I still feel the same, it's timeless. It has songs that make you feel empowered, that make you want to dance all night or just make you want to sit and drink in the case of Speechless. Kind of makes me wish this was a full album and not an EP, but I think that makes it raw. Words really can't describe it
Amazing!Their sound, their compositions, make this album so amazing and timeless.Without a doubt, the greatest act of pop!
Perfeito, icônico, lendário...Esse álbum foi quem formou o pop após 2010...
This album only has good music. I have nothing to complain about about it, sorry.
Lady Gaga's second project 'The Fame Monster' is the definition of growth for an artist. Gaga has gone from generic pop music to poetic pop music which suits her in the best way possible. Each song on this album has its own personality and while not every track is amazing, I certainly enjoy getting a taste of what Gaga is truly capable of and I look forward to her future projects.Album Track Ranking:1. Alejandro2. Bad Romance3. Speechless4. Telephone (feat. Beyoncé)5. So Happy I Could Die6. Teeth7. Monster8. Dance in the Dark
Con grandes letras, grandes ritmos y un impacto cultural innegable, The Fame Monster es la obra definitiva de Gaga. Con una consistencia perfecta, cada canción funciona por separado y como pieza de una obra mayor.Uno de esos discos que no tienen falla alguna.
Este disco no sólo marcó a una generación sino que es el concepto del pop en sí mismo: reinvención, visión, tomar riesgos y brillar mientras lo haces.
Um cartão de visitas espetacular que nos apresenta a melhor face do pop. Dançante e envolvente.
Icónico y adelantado a su tiempo Gaga se lució gran Album nada mas que decir
Um álbum com intenções de ser o álbum da década totalmente inovador lendário uma obra prima
O maior album da historia da musicaUm album com hitsUma das maiores eras ja vistas na historia da musicaUm marco na musica popEsse álbum fez com que Lady Gaga se se torna-se um grande nome da musicaUma artista totalmente versátilUm marco na historia da musica
Not only does this new song cycle retain the Euro-tastic sheen of its predecessor, it outdoes it in sheer dance-floor whump. She creates layers of dark, self-indulgent, eye-popping music that holds up against her previous hits and is, in some cases, even more satisfying. The lead single is a powerhouse of dance waves and infectiously produced beats, but the album doesn't always stand out as definitive, even though it's consistently fresh and innovative.
A bíblia que marcou a década de 2010 e ditou a tendência do Pop. Monster é um marco, seja ao vivo, seja em álbum de estúdio
Absolutely incredible! Creatively made! Stunningly wild! Sexily dark! Her monsters are wrapped into a massive, well deserved recognition in pop culture!
a GLOBAL pop STAR. she’s got the voice. the art. the songwriting. the club beats. theatrics. this generations madonna
Não é um tipo de música que eu gosto muito, mas, é inegável que esse álbum é um clássico no mundo do pop e no final acabei achando ele muito bom mesmo sem gostar do estilo.
Her best album. The whole album is amazing. My favorite pop album with Thriller. I wish she will work with RedOne for LG6.
The album describes the fear that comes with fame hence its name "The Fame Monster." Gaga embodied her own fears in every track of this EP. Bravo.
Tiene solo 8 canciones y es uno de los mejores albumes pop en la historia, increíbles sencillos y vídeos iconicos.
HER BEST ALBUM SO FAR!she's serving nothing but bangs and hits in this album
El álbum que revolucionó el pop, gracias Diosga por darnos tanto arte desde tus inicios.
1.- BAD ROMANCE.- MONUMENTAL PRIMER SENCILLO. Sigue la linea del pop un poco agresivo de los sencillos de The Fame pero con una producción de sonido mucho más elaborada. Tambien en este track nos inyecta una gran dosis del ARTE Y PERSONALIDAD que vimos en Paparazzi y que resulta ser la fórmula ganadora de Gaga. TOP2.- ALEJANDRO.- ESPECTACULAR. De las canciones que al escuchar el álbum dices "ojalá sea sencillo". La mezcla de idiomas, la lírica, melodía, una obra de arte de principio a fin!. Un sonido que no sale de línea pero a la vez refrescante y sin dejar de mostrarnos PERSONALIDAD. TOP3.- MONSTER.- Un sonido mucho más plástico, menos agresivo. Suena bastante Madonna, Britney, y no de sus mejores canciones. Coro básico. No es una mala canción pero me suena a que solo sirvió para darle nombre al EP y por el mismo hecho esperaba más. NEXT4.- SPEECHLESS.- Definitivamente de las mejores baladas que tiene Gaga! De nuevo podemos ver realmente el potencial artístico que tiene para ofrecer. Podría haber sido sencillo. TOP5.- DANCE IN THE DARK.- De nuevo nos inyecta mucha personalidad en la letra, un pop bastante más comercial volviendo con la linea de The Fame. No es mala pero no es mi favorita.6.- TELEPHONE.- Un sonido muy fiel a The Fame. Tal ves la mejor colaboración que ha tenido Gaga hasta el día de hoy. La parte de Beyonce definitivamente es todo lo que necesitaba el álbum para ser un album cohesivo pero no llegar a ser aburrido.7.- SO HAPPY I COULD DIE.- Seguimos en la linea pop del álbum, una buena canción en general, tiene potencial en bruto, la canción más segura del disco, nada osada.8.- TEETH.- De nuevo nos inyecta personalidad, teatralidad, arte. Sale completamente del sonido pop comercial de The Fame pero es una canción muy buena. Un sonido muy Christina Aguilera. Me deja pidiendo un poco más del disco. TOPEN GENERAL: En este álbum Gaga nos ofrece ESPECTÁCULO, artes y letras bizarras. En general un sonido fiel a The Fame pero sigue fallando en cohesividad gracias a espectaculares tracks como Speechless y Teeth (Suenan a 3 cosas buenas pero totalmente distintas). En general me gusta mucho más que el anterior álbum sin embargo no llega a ser mi favorito aún.
Lady Gaga has an unteachable ear for pop hooks. Like damn. Full of stand outs being the singles, fun detours like "Teeth" and "Summer boy" whilst the B-sides secure enough pop-edm bangers for this album to earn its legendary status in recent pop history.
Melhor álbum da carreira dela. Eu amo TODAS as músicas e sei cantar todas de trás pra frente com os olhos fechados. UMA OBRA PRIMA DO POP!!!!!!
This is the definition of a lady Gaga album, having her most iconic song (and one of my personal favorite ever) bad romance.
Simply a perfect album. There isn't a track on this record that is a misfire. I can't understand why it didn't get a better metascore. The album is probably the best of the decadeI haven't heard pop genius like this since MJ or Mad. It's INCREDIBLE!!!
This album is gold, wow! Gaga gave us fabulous work, this album has 3 iconic and unforgettable hits "Telephone", "Alejandro" and the mystical "Bad Romance".
One of the greatest albums in the history of POP. Lady Gaga changed everything that was standard with this album. Alejandro, Bad Romance and Telephone, what songs.
Plsss, the way she changed from The Fame to The Fame Monster, Lady Gaga has the mind of a mastermind me thinks.
The fame monster é um álbum maravilhoso, em que a Lady Gaga procura explorar o outro lado da fama, essa mulher é extremamente relevante para a indústria, há muitos anos, suas músicas foram capazes de transformar a vida de muitas pessoas positivamente, devemos muito a Lady Gaga por toda a sua arte, e por tudo o que ela tem feito por nós, essa classificação com nota 78 é injusta, merecia ser 100, de tão coeso que é, em apenas oito músicas, nos levam a outra dimensão
Its just a classic Lady Gaga that we all love and started to love from this era. Bad Romance, Telephone, Alejandro are huge hits all around the world. Classic of pop music
ARTE TOTAL, lo mejor de lo mejor, gaga siempre enseñando que lo que ella sabe hacer es feliz al mundo con su musica.
This is the álbum Of milenium................................................
Only 4 words: The Bible of Pop. This is the Gaga's master piece. It's such an marvelous album.
El mejor ep de la historia y el que diga lo contrario que me lame el ano, jijiji bye
This album is way more different than the ones from the time it was released and still is, you could definitely see ''Bad Romance'' being released nowadays, but some songs like ''Monster'' and ''So Happy I Could Die'' are really outdated. Overall it is a great album.
Il primo capolavoro di Lady Gaga, un album perfettamente confezionato e interessante sotto tutti i punti di vista.
Un álbum excelente, fue una obra maestra completando esas últimas canciones, una pisada firme para su trayectoria, con su innovación, actuación, voz y extravagancia.
The Fame Monster (2008): O EP do album The Fame consegue trazer muito mais, com mais clipes bizarros e com os ótimos vocais da cantora Lady Gaga. Nota: 9.6
Pop culture reset, represents the best of pop music and the perfection of an artist.
Sublime, todas las canciones son perfectas, no tiene ningún fallo. Tiene su canción más memorable (bad romance) y la idea de convertir sus monstruos en canciones de pop bailable oscuras es muy buena.
lo clásicos de lady gaga hacen presencia en este album. una obra maestra en toda la extension de la palabra
This EP is a masterpiece from begining to end!! I think every track deserves to be a no.1 hot single!
Everyone needs to hear this EP is one of the most iconic moments in pop culture
Hits that are timeless and that you will always remember, this is the definition of the modern pop and the bible that Lady Gaga has done for pop culture.
Monster, the ep that completes what was missing from her album the fame and that also enshrines her as the greatest pop artist of 2009, Lady Gaga is recognized as the new queen of pop, although she herself occupies the nickname mother monster, becomes a phenomenon and brings with it 3 long videos in which it demonstrates its potential
.Una verdadera joya de inicio a fin, letras, música, sonidos, la voz de lady gaga, el disco es muy bueno y lo único malo es que el disco termina.
No tengo otras palabras para este album más que BIBLIA, merece el exito que tiene
El disco que marcó a una generación por completo una evolución en la industria musical, sin duda vino para liderar la nueva era del pop
Una joya del pop sin lugar a dudas Bar romance es una pieza que se escuchará toda la vida!Alejandro otro temazo conocido por todos
I LOVE THIS ALBUM, really, I just listened to it and in most of its songs it shows its perfomancy and gives that desire to dance in the middle of a concert, sing it non-stop and above all with a lot of enthusiasm, I really loved it, apparently Lady Gaga's path is the right one and she shows it with her songs, I love her ❤️
El emjor album de la decada de los 00's!! Gaga supo darnos un album completamente pop con el **** Bad Romance considerada una de las meores canciones de toda la historia!!Otras desean.
She was absolutely on fire... everything about it is brilliant from start to finish . Oh Godga
Love you lady gaga this is your best album you ever did. Love love love it.
EPIC. ICONIC. AMAZING. The videos, the esthetic, the clothes, the instrumental, the lyrics, the power of what she was trying to say with the whole Monster Fame thing! She ate my heart and made me speechless
this album left me speechless. FLAWLESS!!! this is pure art, it never gets old.
La amo es un álbum impresionante Nunca escuche nada igual, un gran álbum, una artista por excelencia
Considerado la biblia del pop, este álbum es sin duda uma joya de este siglo, Gaga supo darnos el mejor de sus álbum y sobre todo unas canciones tan ICONICAS como Alejandro y Bad RomanceY la colaboración de la decada con Telephone: Gaga And Beyoncé!Excelente álbum de Mother
lo que me gusta de este álbum es que tiene un contraste con su álbum debut, tiene casi el mismo nombre pero tiene un concepto diferente. algunas de las canciones que lo conforman tienen un aspecto sombrío, mientras que otras tienen un tono más alegre. un muy buen álbum para una muy buena época. mis canciones favoritas son telephone, monster y dancer in the dark
La goya de La Corona. El disco con el que Gaga dio el boom a nivel mundial. Pop puro! Letras maravillosas!
The album that made her fan. I still can't believe how much this album built my childhood. I need more like this from Gaga.
Find your FREEDOM IN THE MUSIC, TOGETHER WE'LL DANCE IN THE DARK. I'M A FREE BEAT.
Standout Tracks: Monster, Bad Romance, Alejandro, Speechless, Dance in the Dark
Dance in the Dark as an official single would have been an amazing opportunity for Lady Gaga to catapult the status of The Fame Monster, and imagine the greatness of the visuals of its music video.
Speechless demonstrates the powerful prowess of Lady Gaga as a songwriter and vocalist.
maravilhosa perfeita aclamada proprietaria do universo e de tudo que nele habita, incrivel como ela nunca falha
With only 8 tracks and a remix, Gaga gave us one of the most memorable pop albums of the late 00´s. The Fame Monster is for sure a big step in Lady Gaga's career.Top Track: AlejandroWorst Track: Monster
Despite being an EP technically, this is a beautiful body of work that has managed to stand the test of time! "Bad Romance" (and its accompanying video) is easily one of the best pop songs of all time, with its "Rah-Rah" hook, synth beats, and powerful vocals. I know a lot of people didn't like "Speechless," but I think its probably one of Gaga's best ballads! My three least favorites are "Teeth," "So Happy I Could Die" and "Monster," but I still listen to them regularly. My top three change all of the time, but I love the entire track listing. Also, the visuals for this era are amazing and I loved the Gothic theme. Every music video, outfit, performance, etc. was spectacular and unique, a feat not too many besides Gaga have been able to pull off.
This album is a very short pop record that has defined the 2010's, as well as the future of pop music. Serving as one of the most conceptually innovative and powerful albums released in the 2000's, Lady Gaga proved early that she was a legend in the making, and with the timeless dance-pop anthems like Bad Romance and Telephone, as well as the electrifying rock-influenced ballad that is Speechless, Gaga showed her versatility in just a few simple tracks and solidified herself in the Pop Hall of Fame.
This album is ICONIC, it’s undeniable. I loved it when it came out and I still love it
Uma coletânea de hits, Gaga mostra uma faceta extremamente comercial e necessária para o pop dos anos 2000. Certamente se o The Fame Monster não existisse o pop não estaria vivo nos dias atuais.
A masterpiece! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeahhhh
I think that album changed pop culture caused a fluctuation through music industry
Huge debut album, great pop hits. Very impactful her best and only good music.
Truly a perfect collection of eight songs. Well executed concept backed-up by really great production."Bad Romance" might be kinda redundant for some people in world where "Poker Face" exists, but both of those songs are great, there's no doubt about that. However shame that Lady Gaga sings about Verdigo stick here, instead of disco stick... "Alejandro" is a pretty cool track, with nice transitions throught it. "Monster" is simply hypnotizing. From the opening note, you can say it will be a really nostalgic experience to listen to this song. I just love the way how this song progresses. "Speechless" is turn into more emotional, down-to-earth direction with its orchestral arrangment. "Dance in the Dark" is really dark track with nice lyrical details - I love it. "Telephone" is kind of a letdown here. I'm not saying it's bad - just for some people its production can be offputting, while Beyonce feature out of place and too agressive. "So Happy I Could Die" is a really servicable piece of Europop, while in "Teeth" Gaga really goes outloud with sexual stuff.
it’s a cultural reset, a reason to breathe. it’s the reason why I wake up, the reason why I eat, the reason why I live. it’s everything that gives me energy, everything that gives me strength, everything that i’ve ever wanted.
For the amount of success and acclaim this album has, I was expecting this album to be an amazing album, but it really isn't. After listening to it for the first time, I can say this album is overrated. I liked the singles, very much, and in my opinion, they're the best songs on this album, also, because the album tracks don't stand out, only a few do.
This is a bible of pop music. A masterpiece that’s so well done, written and performed. Every single thing about this album is art and you just can’t stop hearing it because it’s so well done. This album truly defind what pop culture is about and it will always remain iconic and legendary and In the words of the amazingly talented creator it’s just “ Talanted, brilliant, incredible, amazing, showstopper, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to refferace or not refferace, put it in a blender, **** on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it”
The Fame Monster Album Review1.Bad Romance 10/102. Alejandro 10/103. Monster 10/104. Speechless 7/105. Dance In The Dark 10/106. Telephone 10/107. So Happy I Could Die 10/108. Teeth 7/10
Not only does this new song cycle retain the Euro-tastic sheen of its predecessor, it outdoes it in sheer dance-floor whump. She creates layers of dark, self-indulgent, eye-popping music that holds up against her previous hits and is, in some cases, even more satisfying. The lead single is a powerhouse of dance waves and infectiously produced beats, but the album doesn't always stand out as definitive, even though it's consistently fresh and innovative.
Gaga, The Fame Monster ve The Fame'i hep ayni cumle icinde kullanir. Yine de The Fame Monster'in muzikal kalite olarak The Fame'den cok daha nitelikli bir yerde durdugunu dusunuyorum. Yine de ikisini ayni baglamda degerlendirdigim icin 10 veriyorum.
10/10!!!Revolutionary and enigmatic. The two words that most represent this album. The pop music in the 2010’s was basically based on this album, there was a before/after scenery in Pop music when this album came out. Lady Gaga was the biggest (and still is) pop musician at that time, and this album just prove it what basically everybody knew it since her debut album, back in 2008, “The Fame”. She did the rules. She was the rules. “The fame Monster” was THE rule. Favorite Tracks: Bad Romance, Alejandro and Dance in the Dark.
i enjoying these songs but there aren't many songs so good in this album...
Un disco cohesivo tanto en sonido como en concepto, donde la mother monster te adentra a observar el lado oscuro que tiene la fama, en contraposición de lo que fue su álbum debut.
The future of pop music as we know it. This album has the magic to uplift the uninspired and entice the casual... a colorful explosion of mental therapy.
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PSYCHEDELIC/ELECTRONIC ALBUMS I HAVE EVER HEARD. You will be hearing rainbows and seeing music in no time. They album is best listened to in its entirety (as with all great albums) but highlights include: Stop Talking, Graphics, Bicycle and Plain Material
Dreamy pop/electronic of the highest order.
Ladies and gentleman, I present to you, the founding father of Glo Fi. Next to Neon Indian, Memory Tapes has given birth to the Glo Fi movement. This album is an achievement, although drawn out at times it is phenomenal. Highly recommended.
Flashmob is a fantastic follow-up to OK Cowboy and in some ways better than it's predecessor.
Interesting effort. I didn't manage to connect with the first leg of the LP. However I did enjoy a lot some variations of these first songs, even if that means I didn't like those in overall. The ending crescendo on 'One Above One' is terrific. Same on 'See the Sea (Red)': it is only at its ending that the song becomes interesting, and for both of them it means that you have to wait for a long time to enjoy it. And it is not a pleasant time to wait. The song 'Flashmob' is as ridiculous as messy. 'Still' goes the same way and benefits from a terrific ending.I had prejudices on 'Terminateur Benelux' but I somehow found some pleasure in its raw and drafty meanders. 'Second Lives' appears as the diamond of the record to me, as the reason I had to endure all those entertaining but disappointing songs. Flawless from start to beginning. I wish all the record was based on it. The second leg is far more consistent and attractive to me, with resourceful tracks that keep the surprise growing despite the listens.
Excellent album. Should be more well known but its not. Great mix of Electronic and lyrics. I love it. One of my Top albums of 2010. Battles have just done a mix with him on their latest album Gloss drop. (track Ice-cream )
Fun, cohesive effort from a band who's worked their asses off to deliver great, energetic music to their loyal fans for years. EXTREMELY underrated dance-rock group that deserves the success they found with their first two singles.
This band is pure genius. Critics hate them because they know the band are having LOADS of fun and satisfy a fanbase who don't give two bananas about stuffy/lazy reviews.
Either you get this band or you don't. The "professional critics" obviously don't. This is a rock soild album with only a few fillers (egyptian cowboy, steal your bones, and you're bored). Listen to it twice, you'll be hooked. How are these guys not more famous? America's taste is full of fail.
Perhaps their best album. Consistent and solid tracks. Their videos are still consistently bad having a budget of all about $100 or maybe it's not that much. I think this album is a new high for the band. I'm disappointed by their next two albums but I live in hope that they can again reach these heights in the future.
In their second studio album, Little Dragon continue to explore their abilities in electrodance and ambiant music. It often remains shy and hovering rather than experimental, a bit more agressive and changing as it will be in 'Ritual Union' two years later. In 'Machine Dreams', the band manages to be satisfied with minimal crescendos, dreamy and distorted lyrics as well as constant and little evolving patterns. The ambiences and moods follow one after the other in a rather intriguing way, even if the tracks often reach their end before any musical construction has been noticed. It is undeniable that 'Machine Dreams' is an agreeable journey but there are just too few specific moments that will be identified as major turns in this musical fresco. The interesting movements as on "Swimming" seem to be phagocyted by the interminable tempos of the project.
Ouch! Whilst the real Heligoland album is nowhere near as bad as this, my first listen was in such disgust that a band could take 7 years to produce such garbage. Whilst the score of 3 may appear too low, for the fan, this is nonredeemable...
A Pretty Good Album!
I was really happy that I bought this album! I cant think of a bad track I heard on Ready For The Weekend! Calvin Harris's best album in my opinion. Best tracks in my opinion: The Rain, Ready For The Weekend, I'm Not Alone
Easily Calvin's best album. Every track sounds very unique. It also has a sweet retro vibe using a lot of old game sound effects in songs. Standouts on the album include The Rain, Blue and the title track Ready for the Weekend. A must own!

...................................................................................................................................A Great album.......................
I'm pretty disappointed by this album, since the boys apparently can't steer their own careers at all...but their voices are still as amazing as ever. As a fan from the beginning, I still love them, but the only songs I can really listen to intentionally are Undone, Straight Through My Heart, This is Us, and All Your Life (You Need Love). Its upsetting that these guys have such potential and they keep missing the mark when you'd think the decisions they need to make would be obvious. And what happened to AJ's pretty amazing solo album?
this album rockzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz :-) the way the brian sings is more nice than before all albums and the linkin park should learn from them bsb forever
Ever noticed the reviews below are written by East Indian fan boys...who have no real sense in pop music or real music in general! That says a lot.....this really sickens me! don't listen to these guys below! U can do far better then these horrid artists....or ahem.....losers!!
BSB is an underrated group as a former singer myself I marvel at how well they still sing after all this time. On This Is Us they do a great job vocally with all the songs no exceptions If the critics and media stop hating and get off their backs, this album is destined to be huge.
The boys return to form with their latest studio album. The songs which are good are really good, and the songs that are bad are really not that bad either (except for the insanely strange PDA). Strong vocals in 'Shattered', 'Undone' and 'Bye Bye Love' should be enough to pull the album through.
Fantastic album. So good to hear these guys again. I hope they play in Omaha!
This is the worst album I have ever listened to.
This is a great pop album. If radio would just play them this album could be huge.
Well, I like the boys since 11 years. I've waited for something that could beat "Backstreet's Back" or "Unbreakable" - but unfortunately "This Is Us" doesn't bring it. Too much of the same, I had the hope their music would grow with them. Solely "Bigger" gets me and is indeed nicely arranged, the rest rather reminds me of what I could get from any no name boyband out there. Nothing that would stand out from the crowd.
This is much better than their previous album and it appears they will hit a bitter audience with this cd. That being said, vocals are amazing - as usual! Looks like the boys are back!!
It is brilliant, i think the best album they've come with and fianlly, a good taste of music. It feels like how come they didn't do this the past 16 years. This Is Us, PDA (Little Weird), Masquerade, She's A Dream and STMH is brilliant and leaves you gasping for more. Enough Said.
BSB the best band i've ever seen.
THE best BSB album so far.music lovers from all over the should listen to THIS IS US and rejoice.and bsb fans should buy 2 or 3...one for them..rest for gift.
This is a fantastic album, a lot of up tempo music.
Just like the other record company employees on here, I love this album! Truly magnificent! A+! Better than the Beatles! Better than anything out there! Too bad old marketing schemes don't work anymore and our fanbase is in their late twenties and listening to Black Eyed Peas. Boy bands must be YOUNG; this is essential to their success. Young girls must be able to THINK/HOPE/BELIEVE they can date the band members...
I think that, all in all, this is a decent album from a group that have done well to last so long in the music business (over 16 years they've been going now) having been labelled as a boy band. Yes their songs are pop and are typically boy band material but they do have particularly strong vocals which are again shown off pretty well in this album. I like the use of various instruments and some sound effects are present from time to time which adds to the atmosphere of the tracks. I like that this is another album that has quite an uplifting feel to it. It isn't utterly 'sugary sweet', its quite listenable, I don't feel too embarrassed playing the majority of the tracks. I think this time around, they've, for the most part, swapped quantity (track wise) for quality and so having listened to the album in full a few times, im left feeling impressed. This, to me, features the classic Backstreet sound with a modern twist and it isn't as mediocre as their last studio album was, so I would definitely say its worth checking out. If this is your sort of thing then check it out.
Horrible. This is one of the gayest bands on earth.
Their best work since Millennium in 1999, ten years ago. Excellent.
First didn't like their "new" sound , but now it sound great!
Great album! The only song I'm not too keen on is She's a dream but all other songs are great.
This is the best cd since thier comeback. The sound is tight, the production is A-1, the lyrics not cheesy. It's too bad that critics will not give these men their due. They've put together a really good cd with this one.
This Is Us is fan-freakin-tastic! Get out and buy it if you haven't already. The smooth hip-hop feel of "If I Knew Then" and "This Is Us" is pure magic and shows the talent the guys have of captivating the female audience. I love all the songs (I agree though that "PDA" is a little weird -but all is forgiven), but my absolute favorite would have to be "Shattered". The lyrics and the arrangement is hauntingly beautiful and the first time I listened to it had tears in my eyes. Anyone who has ever had a broken heart can definitely relate to the feelings that this song stirs up. BSB's performance on this album is outstanding!
Really LOVE the album!! she's the greatest MUSIC icon of all time alongside Michael Jackson. LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!!!
An amazing collection!
How could a collection of well over 30 pop classics from the past three decades receive anything but 10/10? Most artists would kill to have even half that number to include on a Greatest Hits compilation, yet Madonna would have needed to double the number of tracks on this collection to include all of her worldwide hits. Kudos to one of the most outstanding performers of all time.
Since when does a four and a half out of five star review from All Music count as a 70? Looks like the folks at metacritic.com haven't taken basic math!
A perfect way to summarize an amazing 25+ year career. p.s. please re check all music guide rating is 90 not 70 in their website.thanks.
Excellent greatest hits package. Showcases the many genres of Madonna's songs. Awesome track listing. Excellent audio quality. Excellent artwork.
THE QUEEN OF POP! An amazing collection that everyone should own!
Fantastic collection with some defyning pop songs. Whether you like her or not you can't deny the importance of her music. Includes 2 new songs!
Queen of pop! For the haters above, you can choose NOT TO BUY this GH collection if you don't like it. While you are bitching about Madonna's GH, she's having huge success with it around the world, so clearly many fans love this GH, this is a slap on you haters face!
The best album of the year!! A must buy for die-hard Madonna fans!!!
Great compilation and 2 great new songs...celebration is very contemporary and revolver takes her into a new dimension.
Madonna plain and simple, the best pop artist of the century.
Aside from a few missing hits (Causing a Commotion, This Used to Be my Playground), this collection is a testament to how impressive Madonna truly is.
Love it the best from undisputed queen of pop.
Even better than Immaculade Collection. The album art is just sensational.
No other artist has been so vivid in thier carreer that has lasted almost 3 decades. Great music. Great videos.
Undoubtedly one of the strongest 'best ofs' that has ever been released.
Queen of pop.
Why buy it? Because this is history baby!
Now "Celebration" is something to celebrate for. The Queen of Pop brings her first compilation since 2001, which is full of brilliant hits including "Like a Virgin", "Into The Groove", "Like a Prayer", "Ray of Light" and "Hung Up". The album is a full-set length with most of Madonna's number #1 hits worldwide, and although some tracks which are satisfactory to some people are not featured on it (Including "American Pie", "I'll Remember", "Rain"), the album still manages to bring an awesomeness to it.
A great compilation from an iconic artist. The only reason I don't give this album a perfect 10 is its exclusion of tracks such as "True Blue", "Jump" and "Give it 2 Me".
A comprehensive collection of Madonna's best songs. In addition, there are two new tracks - "Revolver" and "Celebration". The new material is equally fantastic. "Celebration" infact was nominated for a Grammy in the category "Best Dance Recording" where she is the most nominated artist.
36 reasons why Madonna is one of the greats.
Her Another ill-fated attempt at grabbing some more funds from her "old" fans! I never see the point in these "Greatest Hits collections"...clearly the artists wants that much needed dollar! There are some really nice collections with bonus tracks/extras and this isn't one of them! She needs to retire and get the F**K off the Pop wagon!
Madonna should be ashamed of herself. Selling the same things over and over and over. Pass.
Someone kill this money grabbing wh*re! She is a grandma and yet she can't seem to retire her self from producing shit*y pop music! Leave it to other artists like kylie and britney. F**k this old B*t***!!!
She could have worked it better with those new tracks, they're boring!
I sit firmly on the fence with this one. Madonna truly is a gifted singer and songwriter but I just don't understand her or the record company. Sure, they both want to cash in on her final release for Warner Brothers. No problem with that, but why repeat a whole load of songs already found on Immaculate collection, GHV2 and Something to remember. There is a wealth of material that could have gone onto the final 'Best Of'. A wasted opportunity. What a pity.
Piece of crap.
A waste of time and money. Very Poor.
Dude. NOT cool.
Any fan worth their salt would have most of this its a cash grab for retirement for the old work horse.
In the end, youâ
Amazing album, the best of the best. Originally, the queen of pop and the queen of eternal hits.
As a Madgeaholic, I had hight hopes for the tracklisting, and am mostly satisfied. The mixes, however, leave a lot to be desired. While I like the Shep Pettibone mix of Express, I still would've loved to hear those horns of the album version remastered. Miles Away, 4 Minutes, Don't Tell Me, Ray of Light - all needlessly bucthered at the end! And why in hell no Bad Girl on the video collection? Madge and Christopher Walken were brilliant in that vid!
Great compilation album. Only purchase the 2 DISC VERSION if you are going to buy it because you get cheated if you only buy the 1 disc version. Covers pretty much all the highlights of Madonna's career so far and includes 2 new tracks "Celebration" and "Revolver feat. Lil Wayne" A must have!
an amazing collection,buy itMadonna plain and simple, the best pop artist of the centurylong live the queen!!!!
This shows off her wonderful career but there are many songs, I believe, that are missed out. The essentials are here, but Madonna has many other brilliant songs.
J' ADORE! Many of the hardcore Madonna fans don't like 'Celebration' and 'Revolver', but I have to strongly disagree - that's Madonna! Foremost she's a dancer.
Caution to Madonna fans: there are several glaring omissions from this greatest hits album, while there are several questionable inclusions, like "Hollywood". One of the two new tracks, "Celebration", is not groundbreaking enough for the Queen of Pop. However, this is a fairly solid compilation. I just would have substituted some of the tracks for others that were left out.
Some might look at this as a business opportunity for Madonna. It might be, but it's actually good, as you get tracks which aren't on her studio albums. For example, if you do not own The Immaculate Collection, you'll have Justify My Love. Other tracks like Vogue, Who's That Girl, Crazy for You and Beautiful Stranger are also tracks which do not appear on studio albums, so it's always good to have them all in one (although I would recommend I'm Breathless). Another good addition is Into the Groove since, as I'm sure most of you are aware, it was left out of the remastered version of Like a Virgin, which is very frustrating, as it is one of her best tracks in my opinion. So, basically, it's a good CD is you want tracks like those mentioned all in one CD, instead of purchasing CDs for one song. Apart from that, the title track and Revolver are addictive
Firstly i will start off with the negativesit doesnt contain every single huge hit! this used to be my playground, American pie etc are missing but when you are Madonna you couldnt fit it one 2 discs!now positivethe album is amazing!! it shows the vast catalog of Madonna hits over the last 3 decades! (and counting)she is undoubtedly the QUEEN OF POPevery song is a 5/5and therefor the album is a 5/5
I'm sure that stans will die for this record. Madonna did a genius move by releasing her iconic past singes and added to 'em two new songs. "Celebration" and "Revolver" Everybody will love it. The essential album of the year.
A collection of the best hits of Madonna just might be something perfect, Madonna proved the most interesting pop singer of recent years, call her ''Queen of Pop'' is not overstate her, your title is great his great contribution to pop culture. ''Vogue'', ''Like A Prayer'', ''Express Yourself'' and ''Ray of Light'' are great achievements in pop music.
Simplesmente... A bíblia da música pop, a coleção dos maiores hinos de Madonna. E duas novas músicas perfeitas. Só não melhor que Immaculate Collection.
One of the best greatest hits albums. i just miss some hits such as Angel and Give it to me. And revolver is very average song next to all the other greatest hits from the queen.
It's stange this album wasn't long enough to include even all of Madonna's RIAA and BPI-certified singles from her two biggest markets, US and UK. And again, this arrogant cover. Her fans are not 90% gays. C'mon! Bring Madonna back to simple folk like IT!

The queen of pop surprise us again with this compilation. A perfect collection of the best Madonna hits. It could be missing a few songs, but it's definitely an art gallery of Madonna's career.
7,6Perfect Legend album with legendary songs. This album can be listened to without tiring. With him going through personal problems Madonna and compares them with his own, and in some moments you smile, remember the good moments. Each person has a moment in life that is associated with the songs of Madonna.It is unfortunate for many (but not for me) that Madonna has begun in this period of time in 2016 to strive for a new genre of EDM. All miss the very rebel and Madonna, but what to do, the actor is growing ...
Another good trama for Madonna, close the decade of 2000's with a full collection of her greatest hits since 1982.The result: SUCCESS!Keep on dancing girl!!!!
Celebration is a perfect collection fo songs but the track itself is the Celebration of life, party and her career. She should retire with this album, hands down.
A really fine compilation of all of the queen of pop's best moments and a few new knes. I reaooy enjoyed this compilation as it's stacked with fun catchy memorable gems alonside commercial hits.
Uma das melhores compilações de Madonna, junta vários de seus grandes e inúmeros sucessos.
My most played album. Please reissue the Vinyl version. It costs more than 1K in eBay now.
she is the queen of pop. queen of the dance club charts. queen of sex. queen of music
The perfect celebration of a lifelong career and full of great hits. God Save the Queen ! Madonna is sensational.
A double compilation of Madonna’s 25 year career with all her major hits.
This album was definitely a legit. This song included many of Madonna's hits, and all of the songs are very incredible. This album also reminds me of The Immaculate Collection. That album like my life anthem. The point it, I LOVE THAT ALBUM
I have nothing else to say except this album IS the finest masterpieces Madge has
The Jaxx are back with the best music since Rooty, with Scars bursting at the seams with creativity and fun. Although not digging too much new ground (although Day of the Sunflowers might have you thinking otherwise), Basement Jaxx are on the right tracks again, having rediscovered the fun that made their Remedy and Rooty so memorable and upping the ante on their production skills. However the main fault is that the album doesn't have enough filler - the tracks are excellent but don't feel like they're in the right order. Although not a bumpy ride, the excessive twists and turns may be a little much for those who love their albums smooth.
The last album of this London Duo doesnÂ´t connect in many ways and disapoints after listening to "raindrops" weeks before. We now know they listen to a lot of generes but whatÂ´s the point of using them in a simple, boring way for your record? They invited a lot of guests that in some cases doesnÂ´t make the songs better neither merge their style with the bandÂ´s, its a voice in some electronic base.Thank God for the single purchase option, otherwise we would have pay for wasting our harddriveÂ´s space.To try it: Raindrops, Feelings gone (feat. Sam sparro), Day of the sunflowers (feat. Yoko ono)
Brilliant album. He completely represents grime music in a brilliant way.
A solid combination of both the old school Dizzee Rascal and the Dizzee Rascal of the new generation. Dizzie's grime roots are still evident, but working with producers such as Calvin Harris and Shy FX allows Dizze's style to be taken to new levels.
Only a couple of good songs disappointing.
Best Album Ever. makes you want to dance. When you think you have heard the best song a better one plays next.
I never really manage to listen to any cd for weeks at a time,,, but this 1 really won me over and im listening to it as i speak.
A fantastic piece of dance/pop music, showcasing guetta's ability to still create modern and catchy tunes.
David Guetta has gone mainstream with this Dance/House/Hip-Hop blend, and that is not a bad thing. Most of the songs are single material, with the potential of becoming hits.
Some good and catchy beats, some songs are ok at best but a few a really great and you cant help but sing to some of the catchy lyrics. a must hear.
Sounds outdated with bland beats - bound to be popular though.
With some excellent dance songs, such as 'When love takes over', 'Sexy **** and 'Gettin' over you' this is one of the best dance albums lately. However, there is a lot of very repetitive songs as well.... Definitely a good album, overall, just that the second half of the album feels repetitive and not very fresh. Still, highly recommended!!
David Guetta released his latest album, One Love, in August 2009. Completing his success in his previous albums, like 'Just a Little More Love' and 'Guetta Life', this album is expected to be the next hit. Its first single 'When Love Takes Over' which featured Kelly Rowland, peaked #1 on the UK Singles Chart and topped many other countries worldwide becoming a huge summer and dance-floor song. One of our favorite song of the album is 'Sexy **** because it's just uplifting and kind of inspiring and what we don't like is 'Gettin' Over' because it takes too long to get to the climax of the song. For the music, it's quite uplifting but sometimes this album can be a little boring. It's boring because some of the songs have a climax that is too late and the lyrics are just repeating all the time. Overall, this album ROCKS!
The album was good. But I'm not a big fan of dance and some songs were quite boring to listen to.
What I expected really, a dance album with big stars and big beats. Most dance fans won't mind this album. But if you do some research and then go on amazon, I am sure you will find much better dance albums for half the price.
This album can't be a 10 in any event, because the lyrics are truly **** but David Guetta makes good club music. Some surprisingly good features from Novel, Akon or Ne-Yo, whether Kelly Rowland gains success in fedding my ears up in three different songs. All in all, 'One Love' has got ups and has got downs (more on this side), but is a very nice LP for a club night - not more.
This album deserves more justice than it is getting here. This album is a heavyweight in house music. and definitely the best from David Guetta. Even if you are hesitant to listen to house music, this album will make you a raving fan.
Un álbum notable, muy recomendable para fans de este tipo de música. Tiene canciones y melodías geniales, sobretodo "Sexy ****". En su día debí escuchar esa canción unas 20 veces...
The album that made David Guetta a household name and was also a huge success. His style was mostly house music before but he adapted or better said added other styles as he got more and more successful starting with this album. He got a talent to grasp the mainstream appeal (Meant as compliment not as critique). For me it is simple to rate. I like all songs and think they are memorable but there is also no song I will put in my top 30 favourites. I will admit that “When love takes over” will become a classic that will be played in radio for long times. Overall an album that I like but nothing I will replay often.
Es sin duda el mejor album de su carrera, de inicio a fin muestra un estilo fresco, alegre, fiestero y sin perder la finura. Al igual que el mismo color característico del disco, el fucsia, sus ritmos también se siente que emanan ese color (suena raro) pero según mi opinión se siente así, tan alegre y romántico como la mayoría de sus letras.
It lacks the over bearing cockiness of Cobra's second album, but it has an ability to grow on you.
Fun CD! I would say its a must have; it has something to satisfy everybody!
How does this piece of crap have a metacritic page and Thrice's "Beggars" - album of the YEAR by FAR isn't reviewed ANYWHERE.
Due to the number of plays "Good Girls Go Bad" had, I was shocked to hear Hot Mess sound anything like pop-rock. I expected nothing but an ego-trip and found that Hot Mess is a solid and somehow modest album for the most part. Each song takes on it's own direction and has plenty of fun, yet at an artistic pace. I wouldn't say Hot Mess is Cobra Starship's best album, but I will say that it is their safest and most balanced album yet.
Nice moves with catchy tune. PARTEH ROCK!!!
It is what it is. A good mix of rap and techno to drink to. If you are expecting to be amazed or wowed then go buy Mozart. Sit back have a red bull and vodka and just get it.
Funny, Fun, Fresh, Sexy, Dancey... Everything is combined to bring the best album for the summer. A must for around the pool if you wish everyone to shout the same song.
Fun album! good for partying.
Fun from start to finish. I can't stop listening to it. This coming from an old guy of 45.
Really unpleasant album from start to finish. Just when a song starts to get catchy the lyrics go in the most childish direction imaginable and everything gets really depressing and crude. Not only that, the actual music behind the words is pretty bland, certainly not the work of talented beat-smiths. Avoid at all costs.
A very bad album, not the worst though. Maybe the songs are catchy for some, but I can't find the feeling and excitement for the songs in this album.....
Blatant, cynical demographic marketing, from the band name right down to their fake blog showing how "party" they are, to their audacity in naming a genre that did just fine without them. This is packaged, produced party music that reeks of boardrooms and business decisions rather than the real, sweaty, organic smell of a party, something choatic and in love with life, bubbled up from the underground. Leave this disc alone and pick up something much better, such as an A-Trak release like Dirty South Dance, or Girl Talk's Feed the Animals, or Spank Rock's YoYoYoYoYo.
Man, LMFAO's "Party Rock" is one great party song. The tune's catchy and full of rhythm. I have no idea why this has a average of 4.0, but this deserves a higher score. EVERYDAY I'M SHUFFLIN'.
Don't buy.
Like, LMFAO! LOL! We, like, totally get this whole "internet" language! And we know you kids love it! When you see the title of this record, you will probably be ROFL'ing all day long, and will promptly buy it the like little consumer clone you are! Don't delay! Buy today, and participate in the rapid degradation of American culture! LULZ!
A crime to all music. Disastrous.
Just bad.
Maybe ok for autotuners with the same drunk ass, **** dumbass childish **** ideas, I pick even a **** mainstream rapper over Skyblu and Redfoo, what names are that too?
These songs annoy the hell out of me. Someone with no talent could have written these songs.
Plain and simple: This album accomplishes what it sets out to do, and that's to be a fun, light-hearted, party album. While it may not be lyrically dense, it may not go down in history as a classic, it may not touch on any social issues, but it doesn't try to do any of those things. It's not failing what it's not trying to accomplish. It accomplishes what it sets out to.
Strong if not perfect throughout. Both the lead and the music/production are bringing their game strong - makes it happen. Agreed the PItchfork review is off-kilter - Miike Snow's strength is the awesome moments of synthesis they make, combining organic and synthesized - P-fork seems to come out of the gate with an expectation and when MS doesn't fulfill it, it gets knocked for it.
Well crafted, deliciously melodic. Those Pitchfork boys missed the point on this one (not cool to enjoy yourself anymore according to some). Easily more hits than misses and for me this this album is delightful.
An extremely well made and creative record, a true hidden gem!
Was recommended to me by a friend and I really like about 3/4 of the album... had no idea about his pop connections but this album is worth checking out definitely! Fave track: Burial.
An outstanding album with several fantastic songs, they have a tellent for bending several genres into one song without it sounding thinly spread or just a bunch of noise their song are unique yet still viable to a wide audience.
http://www.manikmusic.net/reviews/miike-snow-happy-to-you/After three long years, Miike Snow finally release their highly anticipated album entitled Happy To You. The album is nothing but an absolute goldmine with Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnbergâ
Miike Snow is a Swedish indie pop band that on the album "Happy To You" collected europop, pretty good songs - which quickly caught in the ear. Group mainly and in largely part uses synthesizers, instrumental samples and muffled vocals - which in total gives us a carefree songs that are catchy. It is worth noting "Pretender" or single "The Wave".
I like the beat and the melody, the music is great and I am able to listen to it a million times over. Miike Snow has great music overall. I would recommend this to anyone.
Absolutely legendary album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
While the Crystal Method's skills as producers remains relatively strong with Divided By Night, their art ultimately suffers from the high number of collaborations, which sadly, doesn't seem to work in the end.Album highlight: Smile?
Fantastic electronic album. Nothing short of excellent. Get it.
Couple of days ago I played Seamonkey on a proper audio system, that gave me the biggest kick in a long time. This album has loads of awesome stuff, but prefer listening to Happy Birthday! But absolute worth it doing this one.
You must hear this album and, if they tour again, see Moderat live!
Intelligent Dance Music at its finest. Brilliant in execution. Thrilling in emotional breadth. Cinematic in scope. I will never tire of this album.
This album is extremely refreshing. As a matter of fact, it is condensed with many potential hits that we will remember even years from now. The lyrics are also very interesting and on top of that, the songs are as catchy as ever.
Truly brilliant - intelligent pop lives!
It's a wonderful album and i just keep listening to it again and again and again. i should say i didn't expect it would be that good. really great. i gave it 9 cause i rarely give 10 to anything (10 is just a divine perfection.
The best Pet Shop Boys album in 16 years.
Absolute best Pet Shop Boys release since "Very" over 15 years ago. A few of the tunes will prove to be dance floor hits in the halls of electronica... no doubt about it. The rest is pure POP done right.
Simply put, this is classic Pet Shop Boys -- their best collection of new material since 1993's 'Very.' These "boys" are now in their fifties, but the music they create remains fresh and vital.
The only difference between this album and their previous albums is the cover. Each song sounds just like the rest, there is nothing new here by them that we haven't heard over and over and over.
For me, this is PSB best album. Brilliantly produced with soft, sweet and irresistable melodies. The last album from PSB I enjoyed listening to was Very. After that, I've found them quite boring. Yes came as a total surprise. Great!
A return to form!
2 bRAINLEss, The best Pet Shop Boys album SINCE VERY (1993)......Top Songs Of "Yes" (2009)1-More Than A Dream2-The Way It Used To Be3-Pandemonium4-Building A Wall5-Did You See Me Coming?6-Vulnerable5-All Over The World
...............................................................................................................Amazing Album ,The Last Masterpiece of Pet Shop Boys, Elysium (2012) is very Weak, and Electric (2013) is better than Elysium (2012) but is not one Masterpiece like critics say...
...........................................................................................................................................................................a beautiful masterpiece
.........................................................................................................................................................Mmamama
This amazing album, is the proof that the Rolling Stone magazine don't have credibility............................................................................
Amazing Album!!!!, The Best Since Very (1993), Even Fundamental (2006), Being also a great album, this surpasses too much...More Than A Dream, Pandemonium, The Way It Used To Be, Building Wall, Did You See Me Coming,All Over The World & Vulnerable are Masterpieces....
...................................................................................................................................................................................................excellent
The best PSB album, nocap. I am incredibly surprised that an album such as Electric indeed got a better score.
The simplistic style is irresistible! These guys do a great job making great music without any complication. Great drumming, great bass lines, great guitar work, and really great keyboard work on this one!
6.0 z
The Whitest Boy Alive is the band that I wish that everybody could appreciate and know , with those two factors , TWBA will have problems in future productions .But ignoring the problem, TWBA's Rules is as compelling as it is a masterpiece .
Great sounds. Fortunate combination of moden rythms and ethnic Indian tunes. The soundtracks can quite successfully exist out of the movie as an independent album.
Excellent.
Awful album, so ordinary, overrated, terrible.
A perfect 10. The film and the soundtrack create a fabulous mixture of pulse throbing energy. Jai Ho in true Indian style epitomizes what every person who visits India feels - triumph inspite of the odds. A R Rahman has long been considered the best music director in India - with this album the world takes notice of that fact. Jai Ho!
This is not Rehman best outing, considering his other hits in India. Seriously! When I consider that this album actually got an Oscar, I felt what if the oscar guys had heard Rehman's other great works. Overall Rehman knows that the work of soundtrack is to enhance a scene and not hinder it. he is a master at this, and slumdog is just another proof of that.
"Jai Ho" is what makes this album awesome. Jai Hoooo!!
That's terrible, Why it wins two Oscars?! I don't understand, maybe is a signal from the end of the world.
7.9 points for it?, its only ghetto and pseudo-dance music, I can't stand Jai Ho its so stupid song, like the rest of the album.
Horrible album, its has awful songs like Jai Ho, A Oscar for it?
Awful album, I don't understand why music like this overrated and pure merchandise, this is no Indian music!!!, its so ordinary freak-dance, Jai-Ho its one of the worst songs I've ever listen, and this album makes me lose the faith in humanity.
I love it. Amazing!
This is Britney Spears' absolute best album. With songs like ''Unusual You'', ''If U Seek Amy'', ''Womanizer'', ''Circus'', and ''Kill The Lights'' it's no wonder as to why this album went straight to #1 on the Billboard.
Britney is at the top of her game with this fabulous Circus album, it's a mesmerising powerhouse of an album that more than earns being titled the greatest album of 2008. Womanizer,Circus,Out From Under,Kill The Lights,if You Seek Amy,Shattered Glass,Unusual You,Mmm Papi,Mannequin,Lace & Leather,My Baby,Rock Me In,Phonography and Amnesia are nothing but fantastic...all of which should be released as singles for sure.
I find that her new album is just as good, if not better than 'Blackout'. I feel like all of these so-called music critics who have given this album poor ratings merely do not care for Britney, Pop music, or both and therefore they have a bias opinion. Any fan of Britney will absolutely love this album. So just ignore all of the haters, because what they think really doesn't matter anyways.
This is a pop gem!!! very modern, she knows what she is doing, both american and european flavors.
Great CD. Blackoput is much more original, but she sounds much better on Circus which is nice. It's more self-conscious of a CD, but there are some great moments: Unusual You, If You Seek Amy, Blur, and Out From Under is her best ballad since Everytime. GO BRITNEY!
This album seems to get Britney back to the path she was on, musically at least, before Blackout. Blackout, for me, was one of her best albums ever, if not her best album of all time, an album I could listen to the entire way through (except for that "Why Should I Be Sad" which was sort of out of place). This one is the same, with the one sort of "off" song being "Mmm Papi," which is just a little too out there, but maybe it will grow on me. Otherwise, "Circus," "Kill The Lights," "If U Seek Amy," "Shattered Glass" are all amazing dance tracks, while "Out from Under" and "Unusual You" provide two of her best ballads ever (best since "Everytime," for sure).
Simply 100% Perfect Album And SinglesThis Is The 1st Britney Album That Should Get A Perfect 10/10!Great Album!
The best comeback ever.................................... Amazing!!!!!!!!!!BS i love you baby XOXOXOXOXOXOXXOXOXOXOXOXXO.Circus Womanizer, Unusual You, Blur, Amnesia, Quicksand, If u seek amy, Phonography and out from under and shattered glass and Lace n leather the best.
Circus is by far the best Britney Spears album there is to date. You have hit songs like womanizer, circus, kill the lights and radar. Britney's other songs are great too. 10/10
amazing album the best album of 2008 she did her thing on this album it was really her comeback album she nailed it with Circus and Blur and the album is timeless.
Another pretty good Britney album with many dark dance jams! However "My Baby" breaks whole feel of an album for me. Anyway this is my second favorite album of Britney, only behind Blackout.
A collection of soft, circus-themed songs that after a while may sound dull but will always be anthems ("Womanizer", "If U Seek Amy"). Loving "Mmm Papi" and "Lace and Leather" aswell.
How to make a great album?? Ask to Britney Spears! After her dark period Britney gets back with a simply fantastic album, "Circus". Funny and engaging, when you listen this album you feel like in another world, like in a "Circus", because you feel a lot of feelings in the same moment and so you are confused but also charmed. Best Songs? "Womanizer", "If U Seek Amy", "Kill the Lights" and "Out From Under".... Great Job, Princess! ( sorry for my English )
Mediocre, no standout tracks. Disappointing follow-up to Blackout, which I consider to be her best album by far.
The most awful album in a long time!
Just awful.
Utter Crap.
I have only two words - oh yes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Circus is great album, not her best but still good enough for 10!
Katy Perry bursts back onto the scene with her amazing second album that is full to the grim of the tongue-in-cheek atmosphere that got herkhkkjhjghjbnnnnn
O melhor album de Britney com certeza, faixas com Out From Under, Shattered Glass, Blur, Lance and Lather tinham muito potencial pra ser single, esse album é sim melhor que seu antecessor "Blackout"
One of the worst albums of the year thus far. It shows absolutely no artistic growth, the lyrics are elementary, and the vocals are non-existent. All in all, a terrible album.
Circus mantuvo el ritmo de su antecesor Blackout, pero con su toque especial, haciéndolo destacar e incluso siendo uno de los mejores álbumes de Spears para la mayoría.
Classic... Britney deserves to be the ringleader But be honest some of the songs is not danceable.
She is back?and the album is amazing.
I absolutely love this album, definitely one of the best she's ever created and its one hell of a comeback.
I really like all the songs... its more on techno-urbanish album.. britney's back, i guess.
An amazing album. womanizer = 10/10 at first i thought it was a cool song, but the more i listen to it, the more i like it Circus= 10/10 The production sounds like POM2, but it's just as fun as Slave... Out From Under= 9/10 lovely ballad, her vocals are great, but i'm not that into slow music kill the Lights= 10/10 Amazing track, clever lyrics, the New queen is HERE Shattered Glass = 10/10 Good ol Pop!!!! If You Seek Amy=10/10 Amazing track, the best Track on Circus, Love it, Clever, and fun Unusual You= 10/10 A True Gem Blur= 9.5/10 In the style of "Early morning" with a Very Timbaland Kinda Beat. Mannequin=10/10 a new Experience, amazing track Mmm Papi=8/10 Fun track, silly yet catchy Lace and Leather=9/10 Very Late 70's-early 80's, Guitar solo, cool... My Baby=10/10 not really feeling the track, but the lyrics are beautiful, she really loves her babies Radar= 10/10 Fun amazing track, It's super cool P.S. i know haters will come and give Brit a 0 rating, saying she's talented and the usual stuff, i've read it all, anyway she worked hard, if you don't like it, give it at least 4 cause she really worked hard.
I love britney. love love love her.
This album(Circus) is by far Britneys' BEST WORK. She has shown the world that recovery is possible along with time and dedication. She is back on track and music and dancing is her element. She also is able to see her children and rebuilding a relationship with them. We should all be happy that she picked herself back up with help from dad and the families support!! I wish you well Britney and everyone shuld buy your album!!!
Excellent Album, fantastic tunes and suprisingly addictive!!
I think this cd is really good.. i used to be a hard fan of britney a long time ago.. and i think shes taking the good way again.. pop music to the max... and great rythm.. excellent job!!!
BEST ALBUM EVER, great comeback!!!!
Excellent production and the normal catchy songs you would expect from any Britney album. 10/10 Superb.
As far as pop-albums go, this is an insanely pleasant album to listen to. Will it last long? No, but is pure pleasure and fun. Why not a full 10 point score? Because "Blackout" was even just a notch more complex.
The best pop electro album of 2008.
It's very addicting and danceable...circus, womanizer, If U Seek Amy are the best tracks, but there are many more that are worth listening to. If you love dancepop, then this is an album to have. Not one of Britney's best, but it's one of the most played on my itunes. Good job, Brit!
I think this is a cool album...ang my fave from this album is If you seek amy(say it fast).
Well Ms Spears you are certainly back and this albums proves it. You are really the comeback queen with this amazing new album full of pop-dance tracks each could be a single. Your best work to date without a dout. A+++
Circus is an addicting and adventurous tale of pop perfection. Welcome back Britney!
Great Album! Can't wait for tour!
Honestly, this CD is pretty good, but not as good as blackout...very different, but good. She knows how to make some great hits and there's a song for every mood. It's nice to see her back above waters and alive again. Hopefully her tour will surprise us all! I luv this girl!
I love this CD! I just rushed to Target and bought the Deluxe Edition! Britney is and always will be amazing. I am so happy that she is focused and successful. I love you Britney!
I can't imagine wanting much more on what is mostly, but not entirely a dance-pop project. Blackout was a more focused project for a niche market and I think Circus will be embraced more by the masses. The entire cd doesn't sound the same and she mixed things up a bit.
Catchy, Bouncy, Noisy, Nasty, Sexy, and Tasty.
Great Album...much better than Blackout. Only a couple songs I was not feelin', but overall I think she's back in true form. Circus, the song, is awesome!
It loos like a Blackout 2 , but a lot better!
Although Britney allegedly was not very engaged in the project, "Blackout" was so much better than "Circus". With all of her previous albums, there was at least one or two really, really catchy tunes. I was so dissapointed that there was not one tune on here that I liked. I won't be listening to it over and over again like I did with Blackout.
Love B. Love the album.
Best cd ever...im a mother of 7...plus 3 foster children....Britney has been thru a lot and I give credit to anyone who is trying to rebuild their lives!!! PLUS...the cd is just fierce...go out and get a copy of your own!!!!
Go out and buy this cd or you will regret it the pop queen is back on top!!!!!
I've never liked Britney Spears...But I see that she is trying and is working on a better life for herself and her children...I just picked her cd up to get a taste....YUMMMM....the cd CIRCUS is steller!!!!
Great album-listen to it non stop! Go Britney!
I love it!!!!
Love this album - a few of the tracks are slightly dry in the middle (unusual you, blur and mmm papi) but generally another Britney classic. Tracks such as womanizer, circus and if u seek amy show Britney at her best. A different sound from her "crazy" and "baby one more time eras", more electro-pop than bubblegum, but no less enjoyable.
Great album! Unusual You is the stand out track here!
Easy, breezy, fun, pure pop.
Are you kidding? this album is so horrible!
Britney's personal life may be a circus of its own, but with this Circus, she proves once again that she can shove aside the paparazzi and the rumors for long enough to make a successful, poppy, and infectious dance album. Best tracks are Circus, If U Seek Amy, Womanizer, Shattered Glass, and Kill The Lights.
This was a solid effort by Britney and her team, and the album does hold together very well. The album is full of catchy anthems which are guaranteed hits no doubt, but the album does have one or two tracks that seem to drag on a bit. A problem that wasn't seen on her sleek & sexy predecessor Blackout.
I loved some of the songs. It's nice.
Most likely her worst album yet, very uninspiring. Lacks a great amount of creativity and vision.
Fresh, catchy, crisp.
I love this album full of hits like Unusual you, Out from under, If u seek Amy, Circus, Womanizer, Kill the lights, Shattered Glass and Mannequin. Even the timeless Radar and other bonus songs like Phonography and Rock me in has hit written all over them.
It's so good she sounds way better on this album than any other, and the songs are great. "Just don't call it a comeback"
CIRCUS Is The Best Album 2 Date 4rm Miss BRITNEY SPEARS Exactly What Whe Need Out In The Music World All That beyonce and christina All Boring Not Interesting At All .We Needed BRITNEY Back and She Dam Sure Is Back . . . . BRITNEY'S CIRCUS Is BRILLIANT and Its a 10 out 10. . . Go BRIT!
Although Blackout set the bar incredibly high for a "comeback", Britney's managed to put together a great set of pop songs. A bit warmer than Blackout, with more poppy songs, Circus is fun and full of Britney attitude. Highlights: Unusual You, Circus, Shattered Glass, Kill The Lights.
'Circus' is a well-rounded album, overall. Certain tracks stand about above many other. Namely the first 7 tracks on the album. Songs like 'My Baby' are disappointingly chosen over an excess of bonus tracks which didn't make it onto the album. The addition of 'Radar' from Blackout is also disappointing. Although with that, the album returns to earlier Britney and still steers close to the electro beats of Blackout.
This is definitely not perfect as no album ever will be perfect but as pop music comes along this is the best offer our not-so-great-vocally Britney Spears can dish out on the table for us to enjoy. Just like a buffet, with sweets, meals and light appetizers to entertain us consistenly is what 'Circus' offered and it definitely done justice to her comeback carreer!!! As her one of the biggest fan in Malaysia I say Britney...you'll be the best pop iconic music till forever.
This Album rocksss. she's finaly back with her best album yet to date. i love her
Wonderful comeback album. Her last three albums have been pop perfection!
the song are repetitive and there isnt any really new, but there are some songs that really are an improvement, in conclusion circus is a better album that I expected to be but still she has a long journey to remember us why she was called de Pop Princess
Her best album yet by far!
Wtf this is her best album ever. blackout wasn't as good as this one. I don't know what's up with the critics but they sure don't know anything about pop music for giving it a bad score. thisis truly amazing.
Great Job! the best song: Blur!
it's a Great Pop Album! She really knows how to put some decent pop music together. Its more pop sounding then blackout with number of songs that can become hit singles. There are some cool ballads as well, that really show her singing ability! I recommend it to all pop fans!
"Circus" is the perfect album comeback album for Britney! It has great ballads like "Out From Under" and dirty-dancing songs like "Phonography". Other great songs like "If U Seek Amy" and "Kill the Lights" get stuvk on you head and you won't stop dancing, other songs like "Mmm..Papi" are Hawaiian Filled tunes! Grae job, Brit!
For a pop album it has several great tracks, several good tracks, and the rest sounds like filler. Its not bad, not great. If she wrote more songs it could only help.
Great cd!!! It's the come back perfec for an artist like Britney!!! I love the songs "If you seek Amy" y "Mmmm papi". Pure pop!!. Britney's the best!!!
Awful and terrible album. No more words to described it.
Terrible and horrible album.
In my opinion her best album to date. There are no pointless songs that were tossed in just to fill the slots, every song has a purpose to make this a brilliant album.
This is Britney Spears's actual come-back album. With brilliant hooks and a master production, you cannot go wrong with this album. She has gained a new fan in me by creating this masterpiece! Standout tracks include the beautifully wonderful "Unusual You" and the hook infused "Kill the Lights!"
One of her best albums yet. A range of moods shown on this album. Although auto tuner is used on some songs, her voice still sounds natural and fairly powerful on most of them. She's (almost) back to her best. Good job Brit!
Wow this album is awesome circus, if you seek amy, shattered glass, lace and leather... OMG i love all circus songs! good job britney
Sets Brit back at the top of the industry.
It's the best album ever, all songs are great! Overall success!
Britney is back, his album deserves note 10,The two ballads, "Out From Under" and "My Baby" are perfect! The album is mature and the songs are the best!
Womanizer, If You Seek Amy , Unusual You and Kill The Lights almost block out the vile My Baby and Mmm Papi which would have been better replaced with the bonus tracks. Radar is a great song. But by the time it was released as a single (June 2009) Britney lovers had already got the message when we heard it a year and a half earlier.
Circus is disappointing although it contains some standout tracks but most tracks are mediocre. I love how catchy and danceable "Womanizer", "Circus", "If U Seek Amy" and etc. But there is less singing and some tracks are boring like "Blur" and "Kill the Lights."
Overall Circus In My Opinion Is Fine!The Best Tracks Are: Circus, Womanizer, Out from Under, If U Seek Amy, Unusual You, And Lace And Leather... I Hate KILL THE LIGHTS!
Hiring producers Bloodshy & Avant, Max Martin and Danja - who've all helped Britney create her greatest past works - was a very clever idea indeed. OK, so it lacks the style and power of 'Blackout', but it reconnects Britney with her youth, her fun. 'Blackout' quietly demanded attention, were as Circus asks for it outright.She's not there yet, but she's certainly on the return to her pop throne.
POSITIVE - The album is actually very good. I wasn't sure what to expect as initially the album appeared rushed, it just sort of appeared. But the album as a whole i personally think is her best to date. Starting with 'Womanizer' as the open track i crossed my fingers that the following tracks would match the success in production and sound, and i must say they did. It's sounds very clean, very polished. Certain tracks such as 'Unusual You' were unexpected and a breathe of fresh air. 70% of this album is pretty much as good as pop music can get.NEGATIVE - Certain tracks are obviously filler tracks 'Mmm Papi', 'My Baby' and 'Mannequin' fall flat compared to rest of the album. I was slighty confused how these tracks were on the full version and better and even more exciting tracks such as 'Phoneography' and 'Amnesia' were bonus tracks. The album at times also has a typical it will do feel about it, 'Lace and Leather' for example, although one of my favourite tracks, it just could have been so much more. OVERALL - A very good album that is certainly worth purchasing, if your a Britney fan or not. Not quite 100%, but by far an achievment in the Britney catalogue.
Is a good album, but much less Blackout.Le best songs are: Womanizer, Circus, Out From Under, My Baby, Mmm Papi and Shattered Glass. We expected more from this album, after the excellent Blackout.
The ultimate comeback album? For the most part yes. This record offers far more than any of her previous records, track after track you can almost smell the production and care that's been undertaken, it's almost a powerful album in parts that see's Britney return to pop form, leaving her so called "urban" past behind her. The only parts of the album that lack come from Britney herself, or rather lack of Britney. A face can fit and a legacy can go on, but by studio album number six there's only so little the actual artist can be involved in the writing and production and voice for that matter without staring to offend her fans and critics.
Maybe not the right follow up to Blackout and to be honest Circus went too easy about the sounds (Blackout is darker) but at least this is a great album. Womanizer is the best single on the album! Circus, Kill The Lights, If U Seek Amy, Unusual You and Blur are great tracks too! Out from Under and My Baby are sweet ballads.
not her best, but certainly not a bad album. clearly put together just as she was recovering from the downward spiral her life was on in 2007. even so, this album is too 'clean' and lacks the gritty feeling that 'Blackout' had. some forgettable songs, but still a solid pop album. 'Shattered Glass', 'Mannequin', and "Kill The Lights" are stand-out tracks.
The album as a whole is not terrible. Britney gets it right on the singles "Womanizer", "Circus", and even "If U Seek Amy" manages to be likable, despite it's awful lyrics. However, the songs that are bad are really, really bad. "Mmm Papi" is inexcusably awful, with Britney obnoxiously singing lines like "Now see I'm Mami, and that make you Papi, and that makes us Luvi!". Her ballad "My Baby" is among the other offenders on the album, a sickeningly sappy track about her children that she apparently wrote herself. I would recommend downloading a few of the songs, but buying the entire album would be a mistake in my opinion.
Britney's second best cd released thus far. Good production and well put together. The album transitions very well as each song flow right into the next. It also contains her best ballad (Out From Under) since "Everytime". Though "Circus" and "Mannequin" are the best tracks on the cd.
Definitely one of Britney's most underrated albums. People compare it too much to Blackout (her most overrated album), I personally enjoy it a lot more than Blackout, we actually get to listen to her real voice and there is more musical variety (electronic songs, dance songs, ballads, etc.). I'd say it's my second favorite Britney album, after In The Zone.
Britney at her best returns and has made a helluva comeback with Womaniser and Circus... A must listen Although tracks like Blur and My Baby are slightly away from the direction of the album, it glues together perfectly with peppy tracks like If U Seek Amy and Mmm Papi :-P
Although the album is the first step of a re-invention period for the singer, "Britney" is, still, a childish-like album. Despite from some of the songs (such as "I'm a Slave 4 U" and "Boys"), the rest of the album is too girly even for Britney's style. The tentative to achieve a more feminine and adult sound transforms into a sensation of "how would that be like if the Neptune had produced the whole thing?", since they were responsible for the two mentioned songs. From what it should have been, the album is just a wannabe.
if not her best then one of her best albums ever.!!! Songs like ''Circus'' Womanizer'' ''If U Seek Amy'' ''Mannequin'' ''Shattered Glass'' make you wanna dance..but on the other hand, ballads like ''Out from under'' ''My Baby'' or Unusual You'' are so so beautiful...
Womiazer, Circus, Kill The Lights, If U Seek Amy, Unusual You, Papi, Lace And Leather!Damn Perfect!
The follow-up to "Blackout" isn't bad. It's not good either, though. In 3 words, lack of inspiration. Despite the amazing, killer singles it produced and the "Blackout" almost song, "Kill the Lights", this album has no direction. Most songs sound like demos. Do they have potential to be great? Sure! Did they evolve like that? No, not really. Its surprisingly large number of forgettable ballads doesn't really help either. It can'be called bad, because it isn't a let-down or a flop. Truth be told though, it is no masterpiece either.
"If U Seek Amy" will always be one of my favorite Britney songs. Other good songs include "Mmm Papi" and "Womanizer". A great CD if you like happy pop music.
One of her best albums ever! Close enough to the old and classic pop sound. Britney got everything right in it, from the cover to the singles choice. Definitely a great piece of work!

"Circus" provides more lighthearted moments than "Blackout," and it has those sassy, sexy, sultry moments, too. I love the fun, upbeat tracks, such as "Circus," If You Seek Amy," and "Phonography," and I love the softer, vulnerable ballads, such as "Out From Under," "My Baby," and "Unusual You," and I love the songs that mix things up: "Shattered Glass" and "Quicksand."
This album is FANTASTIC. It's funny like no other she has ever released and every track stands out in it's own way. Unusual you was, for me, the best track on the album and one of the best of her entire carreer(too bad it wasn't released as a single :( ), and the others follow up to this.
Esse é o álbum da "volta por cima" de Britney. Depois de raspar a cabeça, beber, fumar, e ir para a clínica de reabilitação, e todos acharem que sua carreira estava acabada, voltou com tudo com o single Womanizer e o álbum Circus, um album pop muito bom e divertido. Acertou em cheio! As melhores faixas são "Circus" "Blur" e "Unusual You".
Um bom álbum pop, responsável por trazer Britney ao topo das paradas novamente, além de uma das turnês mais lucrativas da década de 2000, um super espetáculo pop.
It's a good album but it looks like it's divided in two parts, because from the middle to the end has really weak tracks that take away the strength of the album. However, it has hits, and good hits, since Circus and If U Seek Amy have a perfect production and an excellent performance.
Um dos melhores albuns que eu já ouvi da Ms. Spears, muitos que dizem que ela morreu em 2004, mas esse album provou como uma verdadeira rainha retorna
Britney's most flawless venture into the realm of pure pop in almost a decade (having worked with hip hop and dance on the two records prior to this) didn't disappoint. Full of sexy, high power jams that become instant classics on the first listen - this album has every track worthy of being a hit and accentuates her powerful dominatrix side as well as some of her most meaningful ballads of her career.
Com certeza Circus é um álbum marcante na carreira de Spears. Marca uma nova etapa na sua vida, e mostra que amadureceu, de canções profundos á canções dance, como o sucesso 'Womanizer'
Album fourre-tout, pot-pourri de la pop où l'excellent (Mannequin, Circus, Out From Under) côtoie le moins bon (Blur, Mmm Papi, My Baby). Album du retour, bien mené par le premier single Womanizer.

Underappreciated.One of the few Britney albums that has slower songs and ballads on it.a Great Record.
Realmente grande, um album que seguiu a reta o nome do mesmo, todas as musicas são muito bem elaboradas, nem todas, mas muitas estão excelentes, o destaque para unusual You, Out From Under, Shatered Glasses e If U Seek Amy que são as perolas do album.
Spears' sophomore album, which was critically one of her best, and featured the self-titled single that everyone and their mothers know. The album is headlined by such songs as Oops...I did it again, Stronger, and Lucky, with each one reaching the top 15 in the US Billboard 100 charts. Though those songs were popular, and I think they are catchy, the album does have its flaws. (I can't get no) Satisfaction is a word-for-word cover of the original Rolling Stones song, and it just comes off as awful personally. Also, the last track on the album, Dear Diary, is very, very stupid, in my opinion. Buy it to relive some nostalgia, but be aware this is the early 2000's, and bubblegum pop is just as cheesy as you thought it was.
This album has some great moments, but a great part of the unknown songs for most of people is just there for filling the blanks. I, personally, highlight Out From Under as a very personal track which really spoke to me about what Britney has been through in the past 2 years.
this(and glory)is the best album of my diva and queen britney spears i am a bigggggggggggg fan of her and this is the most strong but is really underrated album of her, that shows songs like circus,unusual you etc... that show britney vocal skills and a pop star skills like womanizer that is her 2 big hit of all time, this album is really underrated album and deserves much more
Definitely not as exposing as the title suggests. Exposure aside :I'll give Radar a straight up zero because it also was on Blackout (Seriously Britney? How did you think this was a good idea?). Mmm Papi gets an undeniable 1 out of ten, as it is one of her biggest FFS moments so far. About the rest, Circus was really good, i liked Womanizer, and the rest songs just fail to stick out. Overall an average to just fine record.
"Blackout" seemed like it signaled a more club-orientated path for Spears, like Madonna or Kylie Minogue, but Circus is a hodgepodge of pop themes that never really finds a face."Blackout" seemed like it signaled a more club-orientated path for Spears, like Madonna or Kylie Minogue, but Circus is a hodgepodge of pop themes that never really finds a face.
This album continues the legacy of Blackout, but in an unusual way. We can really feel the sadness, the kindness, the madness, and the fun times, a whole personality. This album it's really a Circus.

Very interesting album. More mature Britney without losing sex-appeal. This album marked her comeback with a #1 on Billboard both important charts... Hot 100 & BB 200. Congrats, Brit.
Nostalgic classical pop. She moved a whole world while she was active and her music still plays in my speakers from time to time. Sure the music is simple but that does not stop my body from moving when hearing her hits. Circus is a good album that deserves the 8/10 score.
Pure pop, LOVE it! Best comeback ever! Unusual You and Circus are career highlights.
Britney's best album behind Blackout and In The Zone, and the singles are perfect!
Circus was the begining of the not-risky-albums by Spears after the whole new experience that Blackout brings to Pop music.But also, was the right direction in Spears' career by that time. Thanks to Circus Britney shows the whole industry she is and will be the Princess of Pop.Some skip songs were include, but very solid material like Unusual You and Kill The Lights makes the album a good listen.
At Circus britney he made an incredible comeback and showed that his name will always be relevant. He indulged in the production of the album and made an extremely iconic tour. It is one of my favorite albums.
I love the album my favorites:If u seek amyCircusOut from underShattered GlassUnusual youWomanizer
I have mixed feelings about this album. From Womanizer to Unusual You, we get incredible songs, with amazing production, vocals and lyrics. Blur is okay. It doesn't have the "replay effect" on us, but still a great song. However, we get into a dive in we listen to Mmm Papi, which for me, it's one of the worst songs I've ever heard. Totally unnecessary. The last songs are tiring, and we start listening wishing to get to the end as fast as possible. Phonography, which is not available in the ordinary version is a very good song that should totally be invested. It was kinda sad for me, because the first 7 songs are so great, with classical anthems as Circus and Womanizer, but the end of the album seems a little messy.
The definition of a perfect comeback. She doesn't takes any risks but she still releases an almost perfect pop album.It sounds a bit like Blackout but it's original at the same time and it has the best bonus tracks of Britney's career.
A really good album by Mrs Britney Spears, I give him a 9 because for me the order tracklist is a bit mess, but I love all the songs.
El lado B de blackout es la luz al final de Túnel con sus problemas personales logró crear arte
The first half of this album makes us believe that Britney's fully back to the pop game, and then the other half is, somehow, a disappointment similar to most Blackout's tracks. Nevertheless, it´s notable that her vocals are more clear and ambitious, and I think we've never had an album more personal than this one from Britney. It´s really a shame that you can feel so clearly the change from the middle of the album. It´s not THE COMEBACK, yet.
77/100iconic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The album begins with an iconic "Womanizer". I always admired its heavy electropop production, and its intro is just so fitting. I really love every element of this song, even though it might not be cool for everyone. I also adore its lyrical content. "Circus" has this slight touches on the guitar string - it's pretty dope. Besides that, lots of things happen in that song to create perfection! After two bangers we have a little slowdown called "Out from Under", which is a really emotional ballad with good vocal performance by Ms Spears!"Kill the Lights" is a descend track, this time bringing famous Danja on the track, Britney shows how she can control a mic in the verses. And it's so cool to hear sucha middle finger into paparazzi, tell 'em Brit! "Shattered Glass" begins with a gorgeous intro, followed-up by another set of empowered Britney vocals. I love how dark this track is! Next is another iconic track - "If U Seek Amy" - this time middle finger is pointed out to media. I adore this track, it's very nostalgic to me, especially its angelic intro which gives me a taste of powdery pink cake."Unusual You" is the darkest cut here! It's so athmospheric, lush, and beautiful. It has this haunting sounds mixed with a beautiful piano line, synths, and twinkles. I hope she got that unusual angel. Shame its release has been cancelled, it would've been a hit! Now were going into more hangover territory with "Blur", but again with a really haunting production!"Mmm Papi" is lewd and funny, I adore this track so much for how much fun Britney had during the creation of this track. The next track, "Mannequin", is pretty dope and has cool guitars! "Lace and Leather" starts with a nice string line and changes later into sucha power pop with an infectious chorus! The album officially ends with "My Baby", a subdued ballad with adorable vocals and set of lyrics. Subtle instrumentation can be however boring for some.Now, some bonus tracks! And, oh boy, this album has a lot of them. "Radar" from Blackout sounds okay here, especially knowing that Circus was supposed to be just Blackout with four new songs. The song itself is really infectious! "Rock Me In" is a cool and fun electro pop rock. "Phonography" is another lewd entry, this time phone-related and much darker than "Mmm Papi". And hey, ain't it weird that Britney released songs about love/sex surrounding relics od the past? (Yes, I'm looking at you "E-Mail My Heart") The last bonus track I'd cover will be "Quicksand". Oh my god, this song is so goregous, this simple biano ballad turned into electropop banger with Lady Gaga vocals is so dope!In conclusion, Circus is just a banger (minus "My Baby" of course). It is well-crafted album, but more lighter and not Britney as its obviously better predecessor Blackout. Still she nailed it!
Brilliant album from Britney Spears.Very solid tracklist, including 'Womanizer' which is one of her best songs.
This was a huge HIT! A successful comeback and a follow up after BLACKOUT, this was a real success, that aimed her career to the peak once again!
Circus proves to be way better than Blackout could ever be. Songs like "Mmm Papi", "Lace and Leather", "Womanizer", and "Circus", as well as "If U Seek Amy", are quinessential Brtney Spears hits. The vocals are intensely autotuned and somtimes stiff, but who wouldn't already know that Britney isn't a singing person.
A ressignificação da carreira, um álbum muito luminoso. A artista que melhor trabalhou com temática circense.
This Album is by far worth the listen- it is filled with brilliant stand-alone tracks. This is not my type of music, yet i still love Pink and her songs. My only negative comment would be that it isn't quite as good as her last album. Leaning to much towards conventional pop with tracks such as 'So What". Despite this, a great album. Stand-out tracks for me are: "Sober" "Please Don't Leave Me" and "Mean"
P!nk has released amazing albums like Mizzundastood and I'm Not Dead which make you wanna get dancing as her amazing voice hits you but this is something new. her bratty, sexy, sad, yet fun record gets you going again, swaying your head to the beat of hard songs like So What and laughing with Bad Influence. "I'm the instigator of underwear" is the best lyric in the entire album from the latter song.
Funhouse is a great pop-rock album. "Sober" is a masterpiece, while other tracks such as "So What" and "Please don't leave me" are also very catchy. Despite being serious and emotional, there are also fun -not generic- songs in this album. Definitely worth a listen.
The only song that really stands out is the lead single So What, the rest of the album is just repetitive and tired songs. As a whole the album is trash.
This is the best album around at the moment! Her songs are catchy, deep, dark and absouloutley awsome! she hasnt just got an amoazing voice and looks, she is also an amzaing song writer herself!
Weeeeee! Sex is fun. Play this album whilst having sex and it will make it GREAT!
The best album of P!nk's career. The slow songs don't hold back the upbeat party tracks even for one second, and her voice delivers more emotion than ever before. I had so much fun listening to this. Best tracks: So What, Funhouse, Please Don't Leave Me, and Sober.
Not a die hard fan by any means, but this album has some great singles. The slow serious songs may not match Morrissey levels, but the pop anthems are above anything "serious" songwriters could envision. P!nk just has "it." I can't help but root for her.
It's a really solid pop/rock album. It has songs that are slow and serious, and songs that are fast and fun, and there are excellent tracks in both categories. More fun would be appreciated, but fortunately, the slow songs don't weigh it down too much.
Pink has done it again. This album is as good, if not better than I'm Not Dead. I hope it sells very well for her.
This album is amazingly adult. It is SO deep, perfect and beautiful. GRAB IT!
A perfectly balanced album with a song (or more) for everyone. Pink has outdone herself, once again! I love this CD.
All I can say is AMAZING! This is my first Pink CD and she is one talented woman.
I thought this record was perfect. You want a brake up record, but this beautiful album!
It's by no means bad, it's actually very good. The singles are outstanding pop-rock gems, and a couple of the other tracks are pretty good too ('It's All Your Fault'). Sadly, the album contains a little too much filler and a few too many dull tracks. It just never quite hits the pop or rock mark.
Funhouse is fun, but it doesn't have the best songs. It's P!nk's best album, and P!nk's sassiest yet, but she really isn't all that groundbreaking anyway, is she?
really, this album is a rip-off, one of her worst one's ever but yet one of the best. so what & funhouse and a couple other tracks are good but i do not like the rest. this album could improve way better.
Funhouse doesn't totally accomplish to keep up with P!nk's former release, I'm Not Dead, but it still shows that this girl can sing, can make punk songs and can also write great songs! "I'm the instigator of underwear showing up here and there" on 'Bad Influence' is an utterly awesome line, e.g. Some songs are poor and skip-able (One Foot Wrong, Mean) but most of the CD is nice and worth hearing. A very good pop album!
Funhouse was P!nk's best album until she released her new one last year. This album is just pop rock perfection. "Sober" was dark and haunting where "So What" was just crazy fun and "Glitter In The Air" was sweet and heart warming. This album has it all.
Funhouse is an exciting and trembling journey for Alecia Beth Moore, AKA P!nk with her turbulent relationship with Carey Hart. "so what " is a song which can mesmerize people with such a simple,repetitive melody. "Glitter in the air" is simply a lyrical masterpiece. "mean" is probably one of the best-written song by P!nk and Butch Walker.
In my opinion, this is P!nk's worst album to date. Although the lead single 'So What' is a classic signature song, and one of her finest- the rest of the album does not live up to it's ferocity. Nevertheless, 'I Don't Believe You' is beautiful.
Funhouse by P!nk: 9.29So What: 1 :)Sober: 1I Don’t Believe You: 1One Foot Wrong: 0.75Please Don’t Leave Me: 1Bad Influence: 1 :)Funhouse: 1 :)Crystal Ball: 1Mean: 1It’s All Your Fault: 1 :)Ave Mary A: 1 :)Glitter In The Air: 0.75Why Did I Ever Like You: 1 :)Could’ve Had Everything: 113.5/14 ~ .964 -> 9.29Funhouse is by far the best album that P!nk has produced--continuing the uphill trend--and it is the best album I have reviewed so far, not an easy accomplishment. Of course, when we look at the song scores, it becomes clear why the album scored so well. Almost every song got a perfect score, and 43% of the songs in here got a favorites mark, which is an extremely high percentage. So What is one of my absolute favorite songs, and I really enjoyed Bad Influence, Funhouse, and It’s All Your Fault, as well as others. There were not any bad songs on the album, which was another pleasant surprise. I loved Funhouse so much and would happily recommend it to anyone who loves great music, since it totally rocked. Highlights: So What, Sober, I Don’t Believe You, Please Don’t Leave Me, Bad Influence, Funhouse, Crystal Ball, Mean, It’s All Your Fault, Ave Mary A, Why Did I Ever Like You, and Could’ve Had Everything.
The 2nd best album of P!nk is here. Funhouse has a list of love-gone-wrong tracks with the highlights being Sober and Glitter in the air. Excellent vocals and production.
So what may be the signature for P!nk's career, but all of the tracks in this album are jams. P!nk shows us that love can be as painful as it's beautiful
This album has so many great songs, Pink's vocal is great as always and her lyrics too
Such a fun album, I love Pink playfulness, she has so much charm and a great personality
FUNHOUSE is another amazing album by Pink, her vocals are great as ever here
To have a great pop album you need the basics... fun/cheesy lyrics, big chourses, and over dramatic vocal arrangements. This is exactly what Gaga has mastered in... not only are these songs cacthy as hell, you can't help but want to listen to them over and over again. It's a solid pop effort and will do wonders for her career. Music aside...she brings it all together threw her performances and videos and it leaves you addicted. She's a force to look out for.
You go, GaGa girl! The Fame is, without question, the best pop album in a long time! Lady GaGa's clever fusion of Euro-dance, electro-pop, and pop-rock blew me away, and I'm sure it will for you, too! With Just Dance, Poker Face, Paper Gangsta, Paparazzi, The Fame, and Starstruck leading the herd, it's a party where everyone's famous, and everyone can "Just Dance" to their own favorite!
One of the true great achievement of 08! This is true pop bliss at it's finest.
Overall an amazing album. It's better than anything Britney or Christina have put out and it's a lot fresher too. The in-your-face jams of Just Dance, Poker Face and LoveGame are fun to dance to. It's undeniable.
First of all responding to one of the comments, Lady Gaga is not a one hit wonder. She already has two #1s with Just Dance and Poker Face. And another Top 5 hit with LoveGame. To me this is pop at its very very best. About 10 of the songs on The Fame are extremely solid, and the other 4 are still quite good. This is a DEFINITE must for an electro-pop fan. The beats are absolutely amazing and Lady Gaga's voice is original and wonderfully different. Her quizzical lyrics and odd but brilliant style make The Fame a marvelous album dripping with dance and sing-along songs. My favorite album of 2009!!!!!!! Go Gaga !!!
I really love this music album.
Crazy dance-syth album! so fun at parties. great lyrics, even better musicality. this album combined with her high energy stage shows result in one successful artist.
There is no doubting Lady Gaga's potential with this impressive debut but by the end it does get slightly repetitive. From the obvious 'Just Dance' and 'Poker Face' there are also other good tracks like 'Brown Eyes' and 'Paper Gangsta' but these are let down by generic pop tracks like 'Boys,Boys,Boys'. The album is slightly to light hearted and has little dark elements,luckily, she released the Fame Monster the following you which I feel is a much more rounded and confident production.
Ir is brilliant !
The album changed pop music FOREVER! Lady Gaga has had an undeniable effect on pop culture, and this album was just the beginning for Lady Gaga. Featuring the HUGE hits Just Dance, Poker Face, Paparazzi, and LoveGame, this album is absolutely incredible. I wouldn't be lying if I said this album changed my life.
While I can see how people can hate Lady GaGa for some sexy lyrics, she undoubtedly has the ability and the balls to do it. This is the only album I have ever been able to listen to each song more than once without tiring. The songs are catchy, the sound is divine, and the artist is delivers iun a rush of fun, sex, and love.
Well beyonce disappointed us all with her latest and surprisingly this cd was a fresh, electronic dance cd that I enjoy popping in my car. Amazon.com also said it was one of their favorites they listend too also. You go LADY GAGA!!!!!
Lada Gaga's debut is a whirlwind, fast-lane journey into the life or the rich, fabulous and utterly filthy. Appropriately titled "The Fame" Gaga's delightfully twirks eletronica and 80s pop. Nearly all of the album works as a solid dance efforts, but Gaga falls short is some songs, namely "Brown Eyes." The ballad falls flat against the backdrop of the club pounding hits. While not highly innovated and often too over-produced, "The Fame" offers some of the best dance hits in years. ALBUM HIGHLIGHTS: "Poker Face", "Paparazzi", "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich", "Starstruck", "LoveGame" ALBUM DUDS: "Eh, Eh", "I Like It Rough", "Brown Eyes".
To me, this is an undeniably good album. I never would've thought I would like it is much as I do, but it's so hard not to get into these songs. Lady Gaga has a knack for writing songs that you actually don't mind getting stuck in your head. They are catchy in all the right ways. Granted, some of the songs border on filler material, but overall, this is an extremely solid debut. Some of it seems ridiculous, but it's almost as if Lady Gaga is shoving it in your face, saying "I know this is cheesy, over-the-top pop, but you're going to love it!" And I do. I really do.
Lady GaGa comes into the pop genre when it was really beginning to crumble upon its self from the meaningless lyrics from singers just trying to seize fame. "The Fame" has brought forth a new wave of original artistry from one that used to only provide the hits for others. Her vocal abilities range from a dance club hit to a powerful ballad. All sides of the pop genre spectrum are excelled by Lady GaGa's debut album, and this is just the beginning.
Still listening to this album a year later.
A mainstream artist, but she writes her own albums, sings live, has catchy songs, and designs her own clothes; she is her own boss; hey, the only people who gave this 0 are those prejudiced against mainstream music and are too stubborn to change their mindset. Lady Gaga is on her way to becoming the next Madonna, and that is pretty rare. "Just Dance", "Paparazzi". "Poker Face", "Love Game" all fit the "The Fame" perfectly, and the other songs aren't half-bad. Overall, a great album.
This could be the debut of all time. Gaga's sound is amazing .The top tracks are "Just Dance", "I Like It Rough", and "paper gangster". Though the song "Starstruck" gets to be repetitive, even with Flo Rida, and Space Cowboy. this is a great start for any career.
She's pretty good. There are several misses on the album but overall, a solid debut. I think she released the best songs as singles, but I also think Starstruck and I Like it Rough are standouts.
The 70s and 80s inspired artist Lady Gaga started her career fantastically with her debut album "The Fame". With catchy dance beats, wonderfully written lyrics and amazing vocals, the album is not to disappoint, that is if you are an 80s fan, of course. The Fame is generally about the bright side of the fame. Money, love, paparazzi, dance, beauty, wealth and relationships is what's mentioned in the album. Every track has a story behind it, unlike many other pop artists these days. Lady Gaga is not just pop, she is also Pop Rock and Rock n' Roll. The Fame is worth buying.
The Fame heavily borrows material from 70s' disco and 80s' electropop, highly notable in "Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)". "Just Dance", "Poker Face", and "Paparazzi" are no doubt, life-changing pop tracks, while I'll go as far as calling "Starstruck" and "Paper Gangsta" underrated. The album's overall creativity is a bit overrated, due to its repeated use of the same synths and base tracks. But The Fame introduces us to GaGa, a glamorously stylish, yet powerful woman who wants to change the world of pop music forever.
The Fame is both undeniably catchy and forgettable. While Lady GaGa herself proves to be a rising star in mainstream music, some of the tracks are just too similar to one another, using the same repetitive melodies and synths. Its standout tracks are its two lead singles, "Just Dance" and "Poker Face", which have proven to be a bold success. One of its weaker moments are "Eh Eh", which relies too much on cliche synths drawn from the '80s.
Track By Track: Just Dance- good dancey song, very fun & loveable. LoveGame- dirty but nice...it is super fun and the chorus is short and memorable. Paparazzi- love, love, love! kind of a ballad but it's not, it's sweet and fresh. Poker Face- best track in the album such an amazing song, it is one of the best tracks of the decade. Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)- not the best track but its a good listen, it feels out of place in this album. Beautiful, Dirty, Rich- ugh,,. bad bad bad it just sucks so bad. The Fame- pretty bad too i dnt like it. Money Honey- haha it's so cute! i love it. Starstruck- my 11 yr. old sister loves this song. It's her favorite GaGa song ever. I like it too. Boys Boys Boys- a highlight. it is cute and so electro-rock n roll. Paper Gangsta- bad song. she doesn't rap very well. Brown Eyes- sweet pungent rock and roll highlight. I Like It Rough- OK. NOt good. Not Bad. Summerboy- i like it. She sounds cool and the lyrics are fun and sexy.Best Tracks- Poker Face, Paparazzi, Boys Boys Boys, Brown Eyes

Its a good pop Album. Almost all song grow on you after some listens, I liked it. Its a chill album!
I am not a fan of pop; at all. However, The Fame by Lady GaGa is a huge guilty pleasure for me. There isn't a dud track on this album, which is really rare for a mainstream pop album. The last few songs loose focus on the whole obsession with fame theme the rest of the album has and there is a useless rap by Flo-Rida, but otherwise The Fame is so, so close to being the perfect pop album. Check it out, it's a lot of fun!
Probably the best pop / dance album in the first decades of the 21st century.
'The Fame' is an excellent album - it has many amazing songs such as Just Dance, Poker Face, Paparazzi, Love Game and I like it rough... however, that is basically the first part of the album. The second part with the other songs, just kind of feels as if it is misplaced. I don't know, the last 8 songs seem unnecessary and forced somehow. Nevertheless, Gaga's first album is definitely a good one! Good for clubbing and dancing, and manages to provide with songs that will be stuck in your head for weeks, if not months. Definitely one of the most refreshing and simply best albums of recent memory!
Her music is electronic gold. She has serious talent & knows how to make the nightclub come alive. Of course, that doesn't mean she isn't completely bonkers. Seriously, a meat dress?
I chose to give this album a seven because I think that for a debut album, the potential is high. She actually cares about what she's doing for a change. She's not a "go in, get the money, get out" kind of person. She's in it, and she's staying in it. The songs are well-crafted, and while about 1/4 of the albums's songs are not even too great (there's some filler around the ending), it is still one of the best female pop debut albums of the past...five years? Maybe ten.
The Fame is like, you don't know what it's music but, then you hear it and you realize of what is music. The Fame is just amazing, should be the album of the year.
The Fame is my 2009's favorite album. No songs are boring. It makes u feel u are famous. It is catchy and danceable pop album. It also touches a glimpse of Rock 'n' Roll. It made me shift from Rock to Pop. So far, the best pop album since 2003 releases.
Lady Gaga's debut has to be one of the greatest! The woman's vocals are what sets this album apart from the rest of the trash. If anyone could do pop it is Gaga, she is changing it as we speak, everyone feels like they have to compete with her. "Poker Face" and "Just Dance" were number one hits, while "LoveGame" and "Paparazzi" were amazing songs. Gaga is not trying to be a generic pop star and she is showing that with the range she showcases on this album. The talent is unmeasureable. Great debut album!
I like this album better than "The Fame Monster". I was disappointed in that album. This one was great. Here's a track-by-track review on the album (Note: This review is based on y opinion is based on my tastes so don't hate!)Just Dance - i remember listening to this song when she first came out. It was kinda overplayed. 8.5/10LoveGame - Inappropriate, but when I first listened to this song, i became obsessed with her. I've chilled out a little, since there are other good artists out there, mostly previous generation ones, but oh well. 8/10Paparazzi - I love this song, one of my favorites, but it's not my absolute favorite. She either was Auto-Tuned, or she has a high vocal range, since she hit the E5 note. which hardly ANYONE can hit. Christina Aguilera can! she can hit an E6 or even higher! 9/10Poker Face - Overrated and over played but it's her most popular song by far! Nothing much to say about it. 8.5/10Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) - This song is very girly and makes me happy inside! I love the lyrics. she needs to sing this song live again! 9/10Beautiful, Dirty, Rich - Good, not great, but should make it to her greatest hits. 7/10The Fame - Not the best, good title track, but it's just..... Not single worthy. i like it though. 6/10Money Honey - about the same as The Fame, in a way, they're pretty much the same song, one one talks about being famous, and the other one talks about being rich. It would sound better if the song were pitch higher about one key. 6/10Starstruck - Oh yeah! I love this song! She needs to sing it live again! It's a great dance song, and has a good rap verse. she even uses Auto-Tune! OMG! 9/10Boys, Boys, Boys - About as good as Beautiful, Dirty, Rich. Not the best, but it was single worthy. 7/10Paper Gangsta - This is pretty much THE piano song! I hear she wrote it when she was a coke user! She puts piano, electronic beats, a heavy bass, and rapping in the verses and She has a song! She needs to perform this song live again. she uses Auto-Tune also! 9/10Brown Eyes - A kinda boring song, i mean I like it better than Speechless, but ballads are her low/weak point on the her albums. i can't believe she removed this song from The Monster Ball and replaced it with You and I which is even worse than this song! better than Speechless and you and I. 5/10I Like It Rough - she shoulda released this song as a single! it's awesome! and I've never heard her perform the song live ONCE! I want it to be on her Tour! 9/10Summerboy - Hands down best song on the album in my opinion! I love this song i listen to it several times every day! It's a great closing song. It's a hidden treasure! she only performed it at Lollapalooza 2007! If she performs this song on her Born This Way Tour, she should close the concert with this song! Great album and concert ender! 10/10I loved this album so much. The Fame Monster let me down, I still have hope for Born This Way! I will get it the day it comes out! But if it lets me down, then I will not be afraid to say The Fame is her best work!
POSITIVE - This album is one of the best debuts albums of all time. It offers one track after another with a new sound. You can imagine playing this album over and over again in a club and getting excited each time 'Poker Face', 'Just Dance' and 'Starstruck' repeat. She has taken over the world of music with this album, not just in sound but in image. Her image speaks to so many people, being different but stunning all at the same time. Each track is produced to perfection, each track offering difference, but at the same time one sound making it the ultimate package. NEGATIVE. Not many to choose from, but one i must mention....Lady GaGa prides herself on her meaningful songwriting which can be heard in 'Paparazzi', 'Brown Eyes' and others, but certain tracks such as, although good, are very basic lyrically. There is a reoccuring sound about 'Boys', taking her to an anmost typical level of pop song writting. Another negative is although this is an Electronica album at times it almost crosses the Urban genre, 'Starstuck'(although brilliant) and 'Paper Gangster'(again, brilliant) feel slightly out of place. OVERALL. An album that has sold over 13 million copies. Say's it all really. This album will go down in history for all the right reasons. The number one reason being this is pop music, pop culture and pop image at it's absolute greatest. A masterpiece of pop production and an instant icon has been created.
I think this is one of the great pop albums of all time. It eschewed its day's pop standards and made it to the top of the charts off its own merits. Every song on here is gold. Don't miss "Paper Gangster" or "Brown Eyes."
It's like getting in an artsy club that plays something that's a sort of high class dance pop experiment going from silly (LoveGame) to epic (Poker Face) to hypnotic (Starstruck) to actually fun (Summerboy). You "Just Dance" as expected but as you leave the ecstatic club, you can't help but return.
The album is great with several standout tracks, but does not come close to the amazing "The Fame Monster" and "Born This Way". It is, however, exactly what she needed to get noticed.
"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" is catchy but poorly written. "Disco Heaven" is boring and lifeless. The rest of the album is pretty solid. Her second best song ever after "Alejandro" is the unforgettable "Paparazzi".
Lady GaGa desverves the success this album has give her. 4 Number one hits, 12,000,000 copies sold and 5 Grammy nominations speak for themselves in this, unusual, amazing, stunning abum.
THE FAME isn't perfect; it could use some work, such as better singing and a lot like that, but it's pretty catchy, and it's a solid start to Lady Gaga's career.
Fame, fashion, glam, pop, and performance art in one compact disc. "The Fame" allows pop music and performance art to come together (again) with clever sounds and lyrics. There is a type of "innocent fame" aura to the album that shows vulnerability. But in the end the album is about your everyday women in the society of fame and pop music. While some tracks feel like filler for album length, the stronger songs will keep you coming back.
Muito bem produzido, Lady Gaga conseguiu trazer a dance music de vez para o topo das paradas e influenciou outros artistas Ã  seguirem pelo mesmo caminho. Ou seja: um Ã¡lbum que decidiu os rumos da indÃºstria musical.Melhores faixas: Paparazzi / Poker Face / Summerboy
It's hard to write a review on this album when I know we've already gotten better albums from her. In retrospective this album was far from perfect. The singles are really the only songs that shine. Her goal was to create a plastic pop album to shoot her to fame and the album is as superficial as the album title suggests. This is more like 15 minutes of fame. This album is only gave us a glimpse of what GaGa was capable of and although it's a great debut it fails to match up to her greater more fleshed out albums that were released in the future. Songs like Paparazzi and Pokerface are pop classics already and started a pop cultural shift. Te Fame is the first digital album to cause a huge hurricane and GaGa is the new social media Queen.
the people that say lady gaga sucks are wrong...i mean how many hits does she have? like 20! that's a ton! So people need to stop saying that her music sucks and calling people names because they like lady gaga. i get made fun of everyday for liking her...but i don't care one bit because she inspires me and over 30 million more people out there.
An album that will go down in history, but for the right reasons? The singes are perfect but the rest of the tracks feel like filler apart from eh, eh(nothing else I can say), which is a pure pop song that most pop artists fail to create in their whole career, while gaga manages to do that with an album track. The other track which is great is paper gangster, it's a down-tempo pop ballard that has perfection written all over it. However the rest of the tracks sound the same and will become boring quite quickly. Nevertheless, this album contains some of the best dance-pop songs of the last ten years and all the songs are flawlessly written and produced. She puts her stamp on every song, I just think that the stamp doesn't differ that much on some of the songs. To finish, this album also contains the best song ever in my opinion, and it is worth buying just for this, the incredible poker face.
Great album debut for a new artist. She has grown a lot since then and for the better. But this was a nice change at the time it was released and felt fresh. It´s the debut of one of the real artists we still have in mainstream music nowadays. So that alone deserved praise. Best song is Paparazzi by far, which is the one that leads to that better sound of hers we´ll get to see in her following albums.
An astounding album, especially for a debut. It really comes as no surprise that it took the world completely by storm. It certainly paved the road for a woman we can now proudly call the Queen of Pop.
Best debut of the 2000s decade! She just popped out of nowhere with Just Dance and Poker Face. This record tells me that Gaga was set to be the next Queen of Pop. On this album, I never seen anyone like Gaga pull this kind of thing off! Highlights of the album are "Just Dance", "Poker Face", "LoveGame", "Paparazzi", "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich", "The Fame", and "Papa Gansta". Overall, it is one of the greatest albums of all time agreed.
Through this album, Gaga made us believe that Pop music was not dead, track by track she makes us come back to the 80 's without lost her futuristic sense of fashion. These funny and catchy songs about how fame is lame sometimes, shows us her intelligence and sense of humour and, of course, her passion for fashion. Gaga is not about fame "money honey", she is about talented.
Vibrant and unique. Besides being a great alternative to pop music fans, "The Fame" induced a whole mass of artists to focus on dance music. Full of hits and simple and agile beats, "The Fame" can win you the visual and music - even the most retro, which can be less good. Enjoy!
Arguably the greatest debut pop album of this millennium, The Fame launched Lady Gaga into the pop landscape and established her as a pop act different the others. The Fame is the musical embodiment of gold and was a game-changer for the pop scene, with standout tracks such as Just Dance, LoveGame, Paparazzi, Poker Face, I Like It Rough, Starstruck, Beautiful Dirty Rich, The Fame, Money Honey, Boys Boys Boys, and Paper Gangsta.
A wonderful album! A wonderful artist! Every album released, his talent and his legacy growing and most respected. This only tends to grow. Each person chooses his own Queen, Lady Gaga for me is the true queen of pop.
One of the best pop albums, amazing, unique sound, very sweet, gaga knows how to make fascinating pop music, one of the best concept album that many do not achieve.
To have a great pop album you need the basics... fun/cheesy lyrics, big choruses, and overdramatic vocal arrangements. This is exactly what Gaga has mastered in... not only are these songs catchy as hell, you can't help but want to listen to them over and over again. It's a solid pop effort and will do wonders for her career. Music aside...she brings it all together through her performances and videos and it leaves you addicted. She's a force to look out for.
This is definetely Gaga's best pop vocal album so far, i really like all of the song that this amazing album contain , GG Gaga ♥
Me encantó el álbum es lo mejor que escuche en en mi Vida amo este álbum creo que es el mejor de todos los tiempos
One of the best albums in a good while. She cares about what she is doing. She designs her own clothes, writes her own songs, and works head on with the producers to make sure she gets the song that she has crafted.
I think Lady Gaga is amazing - not all songs on this album are winners, but the ones that have made it to the top, are there for good reason. What a delightful entertainer - she's got a style like none other and that's what's going to push her over-the-top. In my estimation, she's geniusly brilliant in all she does - with an innocence and coyishness that's fully deceiving. Her brilliance in the song "Just Dance" comes through with each 'voice' she finds to carry on a full conversation between 'voices' - each with their own unique attitude. I believe she is either a highly intelligent social commentator on (and engineer of) pop culture, or else a complete fool. That's what's so crafty about her. Either way, she's got the drive and the style that will send her to the Fame position she seems destined to have. I can't wait for the next album!!
Great pop Album. All songs are catchy..what more do you want. If you like this album, make sure you invest into KYLIE MINOGUE's "X". same sound and great too!
she deserves a nine, great music and lyrics. Cool aesthetically, her limited vocal range is what makes me giver her a 9 instead of the 10 she'd deserve. She's new, fresh and different.
This is awesome album!!! I like it rough rocks. She brings 70's/80's/90's in a mix to the mainstream.
Lady Gaga turned pretentious pretty damn fast. Even music videos like "Paparazzi" smacked of try-hard quite early on in her career. But the music on The Fame has no delusions of grandeur, a quality I don't expect to see from Lady Gaga in any of her work in the immediate future. Here she is fixed on bringing straightforward, catchy hits to the table, and for the most part she delivers. For me, "Money Honey" is the most original and appealing track on the album.
She' s got the voice, the artistry, the theatrics, the imagery, the fashion and most of all the chutzpah into the album that it feels like the album is alive and breathing. The greatest pop album in this generation. It's also clever. Hiding the depth of its commentary on women and society under the skin of pop music.
All Hail the Next Queen of POP! Lady GAGA is the Real-Deal...she will ultimately crush all detractors in the wake of her upcoming tour-de-force. Love it 2 Death!!!
While Gaga mania has become a fever now, she proves through The Fame that she has the goods. However, sometimes the goods start to repeat themselves, for instance "Boys, Boys, Boys" is a rehash of closely placed song "Money, Honey". But songs like "LoveGame", "Paper Gangsta", "Paparazzi", and "Starstruck" show this mistress of Dance has some pipes and some talent to go with it. This ain't Britney here. Though, what worries me is where does Gagagita go after this? Hopefully she will follow Madonna's move and start reforming herself while staying true to herself
Excellent dance music and she actually sings who woulda thunk it.
A very well put together pop album. Whit this album she showed that she can writes great catchy pop songs. It's sexy, it's fun, it's smart it's everything a pop fan could ask for.
A brilliantly poppy debut album! There are some amazing slices of Euro-dance-pop on here. Best of the bunch is 'Poker Face', but worldwide smash 'Just Dance', 'Paparazzi', 'Boys Boys Boys', 'The Fame', and 'Eh Eh' are slices of credible pop heaven!
I cant get Poekr Face outta my head. True, some songs arent that good. But overall, its pretty good.
Lady GaGa's debut album is full of amazing dance beats that establish Lady GaGa at her place as the new Princess of Pop. Great album overall.
This album is MASTERPIECE!!! I Really love GaGa!!! "Just Dance" , "Poker Face" & "Paparazzi" are amaizing songs!!! 8) 8) 8)
Amazing...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ness
one of the best debut album ever every song has potential for single when rb ruled charts and music industry Gaga made edm mainstreem with that album in 2008
I love this album! Some of the album tracks: Paper Gangsta, Starstruck, Beautiful Dirty Rich and Brown Eyes are among my favourites from her. The epic Poker Face and the avant-garde Paparazzi make this album one of the best pop albums released in the last decade.
This is the Gaga we all liked. Not this freak, horn-implanted "woman" releasing songs that make her sound like the Anti-Christ. "Poker Face", "Eh Eh" and "Brown Eyes" are the best tracks of her career.

The worst album it sincerely a fully commercial album, the songs have quality but it seems that focused only on making an album to the slopes and forget the rest, and the ballads are bad, but evaluating the tracks individually is umbom album, good to listen and have fun.Highlights: LoveGame and Just DanceLows: Brown Eyes and Again Again
Boring drivel and repetitive beats. I've heard it all before.
I love great dance music but this is definitely not it. She can write a great chorus, but with production values this low and verses this flat she has a long way to go before she lives up to her marketing hype.
Gaga's debut shows her talent in catchy yet simple Poker Face and Just Dance. Though with songs like Eh, Eh, Disco Heaven, Again Again and Brown Eyes is falls to flat from being a masterpiece.
Overrtaed a shell, though this album have some good songs!
Lady Gaga rocks! She's such an inspiration source to all of us; be ur self. She writes her own songs, sing live exceptional and her songs are catchy. Don't know how anyone can dislike her.
Crap, fake, boring and it all came from an exhibitionist woman.
Possibly the worst, most annoying music I've ever heard. Terrible song writing and weird vocal effects make it just plain painful to listen to. Fingernails on a chalk board would have been better.
Gaga fans usually prefer "Born this Way" to this, but i disagree. Yes, "Born this Way" is a good album but the real Lady Gaga is this. With an engaging and particular electronic sound and with an interesting concept, Gaga made a really good album. She also completed the concept with her incredible fashion style that shocked the world in the past years. So please Gaga, "Born this Way" is good, but return to this style.
The beat's are catchy enough, but the lyrics in all of her songs are utterly repulsive. Her Christmas tree song, while "supposedly" about Christmas, hence the title, is just about being a skank at a party, just like every other damn song on this album.
Baby food. "Lady GaGa" is a good name for it.
Very overrated. She has a great voice but just doesnt use it as it should be used. The album was rushed and cheaply produced. Was expecting a lot better. Dont waste your money.
Wow. This is the worst album ive ever heard. Her image sucks, her songs make no sense, her music sounds like Sweet 16 birthday party gone wild and shes a total Roisin Murphy,Madonna,Britney, Christina ripoff, trying to be cool+ sexy.The name Gaga suits her. I do not recommend this album to anyone with a good music taste.
Forced to listen to this once at a party. I want that hour of my life back. It was horrible horrible horrible. How can you write an album about being famous before you are famous? I don't know but apparently someone did anyway.
Absolute garbage, awful lyrics that could be written by a 13 year old and music that sounds like countless other shallow pop acts in the mainstream right now. 'The Fame' is only going to last 15 minutes as she goes out of fashion just like countless other disposable popstars. Do yourself a favour and listen to music with substance. Her music is plastic, Her image is plastic.
Lady GaGa is another one hit wonder. When I first saw her I thought she had a wicked style, but when I heard her I thought she was a disaster. "Just Dance" has a likeable sound but when you look closer, you see it's pretty much another "Madonna gone wild" moment.
Pure hype! lyrics like "don't be bluffin with my muffin" are laughabley bad. It's geared towards the 15yr old girls who like the hills and singing along with sugar coated pop hooks. Everything on the charts is synth/pop/dance driven, without heart or soul like most of the 80's music was.
The only redeeming song is "Just Dance". Other than that the songs are not appealing or will annoy you if you listened to it over and over again.
Would probably like her more if the radio didn't blow her up and force them in my face. A lot of times her singing style is EXTREMELY annoying especially during the verses, and honestly, pop has enough albums. I don't care how many #1's she has. She's crap.
Bad music, fake, boring.
Lady Gaga's debut album The Fame is just as easy to hear as any up-and-coming pop album, but is enriched with a catchy sound that carries Gaga's voice all the way through. Not the best album out there, but an excellent breakthrough debut that easily paves her road for future success. Gaga is clearly able to combine mainstream pop sound with phonetic brilliance that is usually absent from most albums.
I'll give a lot of credit to Lady Gaga; she writes/produces her own music which is more than can be said for most of the pop industry. And there are one or two songs where she actually shows how great her voice is instead of smothering it in cacophonous beats and monotonous pseudo-singing.
Even though she has 6-7 uber-mega hits, a different personality and different fashion, I cannot see anything more. Yes, I'm a gaga fan but next to fame monster and BTW, this just bubbly pop. I love 3-4 of the songs but rest, nah.
Strengths: compelling listen, great for working out, perfect for dance parties etc.Weaknesses: too suggestive, overly dirty, can't relate much, repetitive and contrived sound after a while, etc.
A brilliant pop album. It's been over three years since I got this album and I still love it.
The Fame, despite having quite a lot of filler, is a good debut album from Lady Gaga. It's full of happy tracks which make you want to dance your butt to all night long. It's not perfect, far from it. Gaga does it better when she extended it, but it's quite a good start nonetheless
She is The Queen of POP Music. a Title she deserves. She has the most followers on Twitter, was the first on Facebook, Was the first to reach 1 billion, then 2 billion views on YouTube, with World records under her belt (or high heels) she is what pop music lacked. .
Love this album, Lady GaGa was amazing, the singles was amazing, Poker Face was epic, LOVE this album. So, Born This Way is my favorite. The Fame Monster so amazing too.
Gaga made a great first album. All of her singles were solid hits. I had the Fame Monster which was really good. Her songs are poppy, yet creative. She has a great voice to back it all up with.
One Of The Greatest Debut Albums Of All Time!Amazing Style Of Music!
Inspired by dancing rhythms of the disco, the album became a hit of 2008. The star became a star. Poker Face is most popular song EVER. Album of 2000's.
This album is full of "catchy" songs about fame. Its influential, but in the wrong direction. Highlights: Eh Eh Nothing That I Can SayLowlights: Gaga's autotuned/robotic vocals4/10
Come on people, you can't think that this album is actually good! The lyrics don't tell the listener anything and the music is only electronic music, which is, however, not so bad. But The Fame is just another stupid pop album. The idea of catchy dance pop songs only adds up three times. The rest is quite poor stuff and you really don't have to listen to this album.
One of the most enjoyable albums I ever heard, sounds different and variable, "Brown Eyes" surprised me, a simple and touching song, I never expected that from Gaga, but she did it, "Poker Face", "Just Dance" and "LoveGame" are the most dancing musics ever, and tracks like "Paper Gangsta", "Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" keep the album balanced and highlighting.
Is there any thing that's not on this disc from heaven. Surpassing other artists suck as Britney Spears and Beyonce, GaGa has outdone The Beatles and Queen with uptempo grooves like Just Dance and Poker Face alongside the most touching song ever: Brown Eyes. Is there something she can't do?
The first album of Lady Gaga shows how good musician she is, even being a young woman. It shows her great voice and performances, i like each song because all are so great and lively and the lyrics are so funny and intertesting.
I like this record but I think this is not the best record from her ( i think it's the """"""worst""""" she only got great records ). Gummy songs and Gaga has growed up and i think ARTPOP will smash others
She is one of the artists who is redefining pop music. This album is all about "the fame", which can be taken literally or sarcastically, depending on how you look at it. Her voice is phenomenal and she blends many decades into one record pretty perfectly.
Just A Amazing Debut! The Best Album Of 2008 Along With Katy Perry's One Of The Boys!
This album was fine. "Poker Face" and "LoveGame" stood out above the rest of the tracks.
A half electropop album mouth that piggybacked on the Blackout by Britney Spears. Gaga tries to get influences from David Bowie to merge with their pop music, but fails in the attempt. The Fame is showing a frustrating and extremely pretentious debut.
JT's best album so far hands down and better than part 1 without any doubts .Give me what i dont know Murder True Blood Amnesia are the kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Extremely shallow, even for a pop record. The production is fine in a few tracks, that's why I gave it 1 point. The lyrics, the themes, the voice... Just bad.Papparazzi is a very nice song and Just Dance is ok. The rest of it... nah.
Flojisimo, de tantas canciones, todas salvo Just Dance y Paparazzi, son olvidables.
Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference...
Eu amo a gaga, mas esse album é horrivel, minha casa explodiu, só presta os singles, serio muito ruim aaaaaaaaaaaa, gaga rainha mas nao da pra defender esse e o seu pior trabalho
A estreia dela ate começou bem, mas copiou os looks da Gwen Stefani e Kylie Minogue, como sempre a Lady Xerox.
Asco. Urge cancelación para ella y sus fans que son unas ratas. Urge exterminarla
Coragem ter que ter para ouvir algo tão ruim. As poucas faixas boas foram as que ficaram conhecidas.
Me encanta este album las mejores canciones de Lady Gaga y la mejor artista del mundo es la reina del pop si que lo es
Listen a little closer to the sly, snarky lyrics and glam grooves on this feisty debut and you'll hear that this former downtown New York spice girl has at least a few things on her dirty mind.
Just Dance 10/10 Great Opener!Lovegame 9/10 I Fell This Song Is Magic...

What an incredible album. Lady Gaga brought pop music back to life. It has pretty much everything a pop album needs. It's upbeat, sexy, well sang, well produced and most of all - memorable. It'll rightfully remain one of music's most important debuts.
This a good, solid album of hers. It does have a lot of catchy songs. But it still lacks the impact that I want to have, although, I understand that this is her first album. But this is still a great way to start her career.....
I don't be a biggest fan of Lady Gaga, but some of her songs are good, this is a good album, with some good songs, and this style is ingenious (but some strange for me), the voice of Gaga is good, a good CD.
A fun dance-pop album, very overplayed but still enjoyable. It will certainly have you singing along, whilst it may lack some depth, it certainly doesn't diminish the albums amazing songs.
This is a good debut album with catchy and fun songs. Gaga has a great voice and knows how to use it.By far this album is better than "Born This Way", but no better than "The Fame Monster"
When I was in high school and just come out of the closet, this album was my holy grail! I had a Gaga obsession like most gays in 2008 - 2012 but while listening to Gaga, I felt a sense of security with my sexuality. Weird, since the depth of these songs are very shallow. I felt like a proud and out gay kid while listening to the Fame and my memories of this album are nothing but happy moments. You don't get much of Gaga's vocal talent on here since they're mostly drowned in reverb but you do get how great Gaga is for creating infectious hooks and verse lines that I've quoted more than lines from Mean Girls (which was A LOT when in high school).Here, you have an overload of really catchy pop tunes and I don't think anyone should judge it more than that.Best Songs: Paparazzi, PokerFace, Paper Gangsta7/10
No better way than to start an album with five excellent songs!!! And since it becomes much more great!!! Perfect album, perfect debut for Gaga!!! Perfection!!
When Lady Gaga first came on the scene back in 2008, few truly realised how talented she was. Having studied pop culture well, she knew that as a popstar, talent has to be fairly hidden initially if you wanted success and you couldn't be overly artistic either. She realised that if she wanted to make the music that she truly wanted, she had to sell out a bit at first. As such, she launched herself as an attractive, sexy popstar with top quality pop tunes that the public ate up. But a lot of people thought she was all style, no substance, couldn't sing, play an instrument or had anything interesting to say. But towards the end of The Fame's album campaign, she started changing a bit. She started pushing her vocal performances to prove she had a voice, she started playing piano live (a talent in which she was classically trained and had led to offers from Juliard) and she began to say rather intelligent things in interviews. And if you truly listened to her album, you would find that The Fame is highly satirical. The songs sound as if she is advocating a superficial lifestyle but on closer inspection, you realise she is actually critiquing it. Especially evident on songs like Paparazzi, The Fame, Just Dance, Lovegame and Money Honey, Lady Gaga is clearly "in on the joke." She cleverly released an album that sounded mainstream enough to sell yet its songs were actually picking fun at the mainstream if you listened closely. But the album wasn't just a swipe at fame. It also has genuinely touching ballads Brown Eyes and Again Again (available on some worldwide editions). Lady Gaga would go on to create better albums, but The Fame is still good for what it was. This album was the stepping stone that she needed to become famous and she could show her true talent later on, when the public had accepted her. All she needed was to open that door to be accepted in the first place and she could go her own way afterwards. The Fame was the perfect vehicle for this ambition. Not quite as outstanding when looking back on it 5 years later, but still very good as a pop album.
I love Lady Gaga. This album is truly amazing. You can listen to it at any time, and the upbeat tracks will cheer you up immediately. Definitely a must buy.
Ambicioso ao extremo, temos uma novata na cena pop cantando sobre a fama: seus luxos e lixos. Lady Gaga consegue transformar um álbum de estréia em uma performance, dando vida ao conceito do disco através de sua própria carreira. Era apenas o começo.
amazing album, she managed to create an album electopop iconic, one of the best albums of recent years, the electronic sound mixed with pop and fashion made a success of THE FAME
perfect material, perfect production, it´s an amazing pop album with a good vibe and influences, it´s fresh, funny, catchy, i could dance all night longe, lady gaga is an amazing singer and she´s so experimental, so smart with her songs, that´s why i like her music so so much good luck girl, you´re gonna so so far
Between Poker Face, Just Dance and Nothing Else I Can Say, you'll feel that this album has been in your head forever. That's not necessarily a bad thing :P
Un gran album debut, tiene canciones muy bailables que mezclan la fama con el amor, ademas tiene canciones que te recordaran tiempos memorables como los 80's!
Years later after release I'm still loving The Fame. It still gets me dancing! It's such a great album and it a definitely a classic. I would recommend buying this on iTunes.Every song is amazing. I guarantee this is a great album to have, that can compare to any album of today.My Personal favorites are: Love Game, Poker Face, Just Dance, and Starstruck.
I was not a Gaga fan until I saw her "Fame Ball" tour and then it all changed. She channels a fresh pop sensibility into each track. Her knowing of how to energize a crowd will surely give her longevity.
As we all know Lady Gaga is the bomb. This album is the beginning of her career. It includes Poker Face and Paparazzi (among all her great songs on here). If you appreciate fine pop music, even if you are not a Lady Gaga fan, you will become one once you hear this album. It is amazing!
A mildly favourable album, with pop songs that will appeal to the masses due to the infectious tunes and beats. Songs like Eh, Eh, Starstruck & Boys Boys Boys are easy on the ears while Just Dance & Poker Face are obvious club bangers, with the latter two later becoming the breakthroughs for her career. There's nothing much to dislike on the album, but most of the later songs played are obvious fillers. With the exception of Eh, Eh, Lady Gaga and her record label definitely chose the right hits to represent her album as singles.Standout Tracks: Just Dance (ft. Colby O'Donis), LoveGame, Poker Face
She has everything to be a star in pop music. "The Fame" is one of the best debut albums of the decade. "Just Dance", "Poker Face", "Paparazzi" and "Brown Eyes" are my most recommended songs. Lady Gaga gave a new breath to pop culture with this fresh music but certainly she needs to polish herself a little bit more as an artist and explore all the talent she has to be on top.
The Fame is undoubtedly one of the most impactful and iconic debut albums in modern pop music. It catapulted Lady Gaga into stardom and our hearts. Here she shows off her songwriting abilities and vocal versatility, effortlessly singing through smash hits "Poker Face, "Just Dance" and "Paparazzi". The Fame also helped bring electronic music back into the mainstream through the help of its singles, and also ventures into experimental territories on "Paper Gangster" and more retro sounds on "Summerboy" and "Disco Heaven". Filler tracks are virtually nonexistent, and we start to see some of the musical threads continued on its sequel, The Fame Monster. Although it may not be Gaga's best work, it still stands alone as a monolith of pop culture, one of the defining albums of 2008.
Ahh,good old Lady Gaga, it all started here,good old The Fame days, the days then Lady Gaga was new,fresh "it girl", The Fame is not bad, I would say even a good album with a many hits and few slower songs in the back, Poker Face shows this album potential it has, amazing work Lady Gaga! My first physical CD and digital album I bought and I'm very happy with that,I was satisfied!
Overall great debut album, she was my 2009, highlights are just dance, poker face, paparazzi, lovegame, I like it rough, money honey, boys boys boys and brown eyes
This album just isn't her best. Yeah, it's a debut album, but it could be better produced and edited. However, there are still 4 or 5 songs that are quite enjoyable to my ears.
I think her not bad voice is marred by her reliance on gimmickry and calling that gimmickry 'artistic credibility.'I liked her music more before I saw the dumb videos that they made for the songs. Her obsession with the ridiculous makes her someone I wouldn't bother following-I think some of her lyrics are kind of messed up if you bother to pay attention to them-its amazing that she hasn't managed to off herself out of sheer stupidity since the inception of her "musical career." Say by falling headfirst into a toilet & getting stuck there or simply by walking off the edge of a building, high as a kite.
E ela veio pra salvar a música pop com esse album,trazer de volta a graça que se tinha perdido.Não é a toa que já vendeu mais de 20 milhões de cópias.
Some songs of this album were written years ago, at the time Lady Gaga still dreamed to be a popstar, for example "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich". This prove that she's been working on music since the beginning. With 8 years old Gaga has already knew how to play piano and dance. Her first album 'The Fame" crossed many taboo and became one of the most important album in pop music!
a truly perfect album starts with a catchy song Just Dance is for sure these songs are a masterpiece, and one of the best CDs of the decade, Lady Gaga and her team are to be congratulated.
Definitely the game changer album of POP. Pop will never be low brow. Lady Gaga have changed the game of POP entirely, the singles are really fantastic and bops. From Just Dance to Paparazzi, I enjoyed all of them. The album will never get old. It deserved #1.
One of the best debut albums of all time. Changed radio. Iconic. Standout tracks: Paparazzi, Poker Face, Paper Gangsta
The best dance pop I ever heard. The synths and the bass sounds so amazing and live is so good. My Favorites:1 - Poker Face2 - Just Dance3 - Paparazzi4 - Brown Eyes5 - Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)
Lady Gaga's debut album The Fame is just as easy to hear as any up-and-coming pop album, but is enriched with a catchy sound that carries Gaga's voice all the way through. Not the best album out there, but an excellent breakthrough debut that easily paves her road for future success. Gaga is clearly able to combine mainstream pop sound with phonetic brilliance that is usually absent from most albums.
The Fame is an amazing album to say the least. She, at first, lacks credibility as an artist, but she convinced me with Just Dance, Poker Face and Paparazzi.
This album show the world a girl who came to music to change the pop music, and the get the change in this album, this album is a complete revolution of pop music
One of the greatest debut albums by an artist. The album delves into the idea of 'The Fame' to give us a narrative, filled with standout Dance-Pop anthems, touches of Disco, and R&B infused beats. The Dance fueled tracks of the album give an insight as to who Lady Gaga is, and who she is to become with a very long career ahead of her. She isn't stopping any time soon.
Definitely one of the best and strongest debut albums of all times. If you haven't heard it yet, then you're not breathing as it's hit singles have become some of the biggest hits of all time like Just Dance, Poker Face and Paparazzi. An awesome concept album about fame, and all the fun things that you do when you have it. Gaga made her mark on the industry with this album, and it was so good that she became the biggest popstar out there! Queen!
Álbum dos Hits Just Dance, Love Game, Paparazzi e Poker Face. Mas amo The Fame e Retro, Dance, Freak são perfeitas, a Sonoridade de I Like It Rough, é muito boa. esse é um ótimo Álbum de estreia.
A massive breakout, a massive debut. One of the biggest releases in pop to ever exist, proves that Lady Gaga has only just begun. The music is purely perfect.
This album is the ultimate pop masterpiece, it was the first album that I bought from my money in 2009 because it was too good for its time when it was released, she basically saved pop music. I still cannot stop playing it so much I'm still in love after years this album is amazing and timeless.
I'm not as fond of this album as critics are. It's a solid debut from Lady Gaga, but I feel as if the majority of this album is dull synthpop from RedOne among others with not-so-creative lyrics. This earns the album a B-. Highlights: "Paparazzi", "Starstruck", "LoveGame". Worst song: "Summerboy"
Good, nice and quality is as I was to The Fame. Multi danceable songs with one another ballad, Gaga shows us her debut as a reminder never to forget and be an appreciation of the good pop that is should continue and not a commercial waste as today
Amazing debut album. Revolutionary! Worth listening! Great concept of Fame and all the luxuries than comes with it. Songs are cohesive.
Futuristic, but at the same time retrograde . He and a mixing disk with a new type of pop music of birth, while one takes you to other clubs slopes lead you to magnificent nightclubs. The album was instrumental in the revolution of pop music . We can say that he who brought pop right back in evidence but this time for music and not for beauty. The album itself is intelligent. One of the highest points and she managed to unite excellent music and agrdavéis to listen and dance . I say to say that this album and a masterpiece and that few have done and will do as good as albums .
The Fame presents a raw GaGa who is in the verge of exploring the world of fame and its sub-dimensions. The songs are fresh and are reminiscent of 80's pop world.
A futuristic, dancing and street's album with a 80s and 90s influence. It gets better than that all
Gaga estreia no mundo da música nos dando um álbum bom, mas que não impressiona. Com músicas boas (algumas ótimas), os singles foram bem escolhidos e fizeram muito sucesso.Pontos altos: Paparazzi, Poker Face, Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)Pontos baixos: Money Honey, Disco Heaven, Boys Boys Boys
i like this album but i think its one of gaga's worsts projects, taking off "poker face", "paparazzi", "lovegame", "just dance" and "summerboy", i think the album is so forgattable
A great album, with great writing, great production, the duo Gaga/RedOne proved to be hit-makers, but in the end, you want a bit more... which you can find on The Fame Monster. But this is still a great debut album.
A great debut album with a modern sound and fresh ideas, its no wonder the album performed so well. Favourites include Poker Face, Paparazzi, Paper Gangsta, Eh Eh and Summer Boy
What a great debut album. I like almost every song on this album. She did a great job.
Um Pop revolucionário! Simplesmente o melhor álbum Pop até a data. Eletrizante, dançante. Com elementos que lembram os anos 80. Remetendo a Madonna, Michael e inusitado David Bowie. Uma obra prima para um álbum de estréia .
this is the best and the biggest album debut of all timeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee im a big fan of gaga and that shows a new face of the pop music,it bring to us poker face,just dance,love game and other amazing hits and that is her 2 best album i really love that,very strong and big quality album
Lady Gaga y electro-pop mas fieles a la escena Pop, es un álbum muy bailable y muy fiel al genero disco gay. Es la combinación perfecta para finales del 2008 donde se pedía a gritos música como esta.Como su nombre lo indica "The Fame", el salto a la fama de una de las artista mas importante de la ultima generación, siempre ocupara un lugar especial en aquellas personas que anhelaron lo "Freak" en este neo mundo.
Um bom álbum, mostra claramente uma grande estrela pop em ascenção. The Fame é um bom álbum de estreia para Gaga, bem radiofônico, bem pop clean, com vocais de 'menininha', com várias músicas hits como Poker Face, Paparazzi, Just Dance, Summerboy e Starstruck. Porém, enjoa fácil.
A welcome debut for Lady Gaga. Minimal skips and a textured look at newfound fame.
THE GREATEST DEBUT ALBUM BY A FEMALE THIS CENTURY. Lady Gaga brought a new sound into pop culture and changed the music world completely. No matter what everyone says, Lady Gaga joins Madonna and Britney Spears as one of the best biggest female pop icons of all time.
Não esperava menos da RAINHA DO POP NÉ MORES. Crazy dance-syth album! so fun at parties. great lyrics, even better musicality. this album combined with her high energy stage shows result in one successful artist.
Her fist album with one of the most powerful songs at her career: Paparazzi. Everybody knows Just Dance, Poker Face, Eh, Eh, and Little Monsters love Fame and Love Game, Boys, Boys, Boys, Beautiful, Dirty, Rich, and others. Queen of firsts albums!
I really enjoy this album, Gaga is art, she is the best pop artist in the world.......................................................................
Gaga cambió la manera de hacer musica pop desde 2008. Este álbum cuenta con gran innovación en el genero dance-pop y el concepto del álbum es muy acertado y coherente con sus letras. En el final de la decada de los 00's se tuvo una gran carencia de música pop pura, con The Fame se inció una nueva era musical.
Pues es un álbum sumamente pop, muy comercial, muy Gaga, y es que ella llegó para cambiar las reglas del juego, este es el álbum que cambio todo. Sin duda alguna Gaga se ganó el corazón de todos con esta gran joya.
Arguably the best debut album in history, it made pop music relevant and mainstream again and it did so with great beats, fun lyrics and eye catching music videos.
hinário dance, todas as músicas tinham potencial pra ser single, simplesmente um marco
O ALBÚM TROUXE DE VOLTA O DANCE PARA OS CHARTS SE CONSOLIDANDO COMO RAINHA DO POP!
If you thought that this would be a pop masterpiece then you were wrong and is that despite not being bad Gaga did not fulfill what was promised to be the album of the decade
"The Fame" was Lady Gaga's debut back in 2008, this album made everyone in the music industry step up their game and start pushing boundaries. Truly a piece of modern art that started a new era along with the digital sales.
Though Gaga started out in New York's tough-to-break club scene, her ability to pick out a good hook (along with her ability to spot a good producer) makes The Fame sound like a unified whole -- something that's truly amazing when you account for the fact that five different producers/beatmakers were brought in to craft this disc.So is The Fame a modern-day club classic? Sadly, no, as Gaga's desire to try new sounds and genres can sometimes submerge her in waters in which she's just not ready to swim in. Yet The Fame is still a solid dance album -- and, really, when you're in the middle of your favorite nightclub at 2 a.m. in the morning, dancing like there's no tomorrow, isn't that all that matters?
De los mejores discos pop que he escuchado y con un impacto masivo y a día de hoy sigue teniendo ese toque
Es un excelente álbum de principio a final; las letras, las melodías, la producción, el impacto que tuvo en la música pop, etc. hace que este álbum sea uno de los mejores y más representativos de su genero.
Her best work ever. We can count the title, the lyrics that totally match the content of the album and of course the beats from the 80's. A-m-a-z-i-n-g.
El álbum que cambió el pop por completo en aquellos años. Este álbum tiene hit tras hit, aunque se hecha en falta que sea más cohesivo. No hace falta decir nada más, uno de los mejores debuts de la historia.
Uno de los mayores debuts de la historia. Un disco que cambió la música pop, junto a The Fame Monster, a finales de los 2000 y principios de los 2010. No solo la música, sino la moda, la forma de dar los espectáculos, la creación de vídeos musicales y el uso de Internet para la comercialización de la música cambió, para siempre, con la llegada de Lady Gaga.En este disco encontramos una producción brillante, con una voz clara, limpia, potente y dramática. Grandes canciones, con algún altibajo, una temática interesante, la de la fama, y unas letras tontas y divertidas que anuncian la llegada de una de las mayores artistas que ha tenido el pop.Mejor canción: Poker Face; un clásico contemporáneoPeor canción: Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say); suena a una demo sin acabar y no pega con el resto de álbum, demasiado dulce en comparación
Fun album, almost every song deserved to be a single. Bops and fun songs non stop. A massive debut.
I love this album. It's sometimes very dark, and sometimes very bright. Sometimes is just Gaga and piano, and sometimes it's lots of production. It's very good album, and definitively the best Gaga album so far!
This is a very good pop album, it has a timeless songs and icons hits like pokerface, paparazzi, and just dance, 10 songs are excellent, 4 are good, the lyrics are cheesy, this electro pop is amazing. You will enjoy and love this album.
In their debut material the pop star features tracks that work, smartly, alone. Going on a Disco vibe we clearly see an influence of "Confessions On A Dance Floor" very well used
Dificilmente você encontrará alguém que nunca tenha ouvido Poker Face ou Just Dance. Gaga trouxe hits memoráveis e atemporais. Love Game e Paparazzi são, sem dúvidas, as minhas preferidas. Uma junção de sonoridade viciante + clipes memoráveis.
"The Fame" started Lady Gaga's incredible career and is probably the best debut album of all time. Not only was it successful but this album, along with Britney Spears' "Blackout" (2007), started the dance pop trend that lasted for several years. The album is mainly a dance pop and electropop album. It’s mostly upbeat dance tracks, a few midtempos here and here and one piano ballad. The four highlights off the album are definitely the legendary singles "Just Dance", "Poker Face", "LoveGame" and "Paparazzi". Those songs haven’t aged a day and are still fun. Some other highlights are the "Starstruck" and "I Like It Rough". Both two dancy songs that could’ve been huge hits for Gaga. Two missed opportunities. The most underrated track on the album is "Paper Gangsta". It’s more midtempo compared to the previously mentioned tracks and has a pretty unique production. Definitely not single material but definitely a hidden gem. "The Fame" is a pop music classic and one of the most iconic albums of the 2000s. Like I said, I think it’s the best debut album. I only give 9 points instead of 10 points because parts of the album have aged ("Boys Boys Boys" / "Brown Eyes"). Iconic album.Highlights: Paper Gangsta, I Like It Rough, Starstruck & the four singles
Em seu debut, Gaga consegue construir um trabalho coeso e interessante. The Fame expressa o potencial da artista e sua capacidade de entreter.
The album with which the phenomenon was born, called Lady Gaga, one of the best artists in the world and in history.
i'm just passing by ok.......................................................................................................
One of the best selling albums ever was released by unknown girl named Lady Gaga. Nobody could now that after years she still will be so popular. Her next releases will become even more cooler and after years she will be saving pop music. But I rate this album 9, because some songs seem boring and Gaga could replace them.
Perdeito, icônico um marco no pop...Paparazzi é a melhor faixa do álbum...
Lady Gaga's debut album 'The Fame' is the dirtiest pop debut I've ever seen from an artist, but it works so well for her. While many songs are quite generic, that is to be expected with a debut project from a pop singer. Some of the tracks do feel quite similar with the same autotune being used on Gaga's vocals. Also the chorus of many of the songs also feel generic, especially towards the end of the record. My favorite part of the album is definitely the first half, but the entire project is a delight to listen to, and it's a decent first album for the legendary singer.Album Track Ranking:1. Paparazzi2.

Después de una década The Fame se sigue sintiendo fresco, ritmos que siguen siendo actuales y canciones que seguirán vigentes por una década más.Lady Gaga y sus respectivos productores fueron pioneros en la música pop de los 2010´s lanzando un Álbum que inspiró cientos y cientos mas.La desventaja es que un a producción así no permite apreciar la calidad vocal del artista, lo cual es una pena.
El mejor Album debut de todos los tiempos sonidos revolucionarios y una gran obra maestra wow Gaga es una Diosa
Álbum injustiçado merecia muitos grammys lendário e atemporal uma obra de arte
Fueled by heavy dance tracks and popping electronic beats, «The Fame», the first album by the glamorous Lady Gaga, is a well-crafted sampling of feisty anti-pop in high quality. This full-length album proves she's more than one hit and a bag of stage tricks. Drawing on ’70s disco and ’80s electro pop for the 12 tracks that make up «The Fame», Gaga writes deluxe ditties that compel the listener to “just dance”. Empty lyrics are all part of the game when it comes to creating pop music — and Lady Gaga looks to have hit the jackpot here with her blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting.
Lady Gaga teve como marco em seu debut o diferente, ousado e esplêndido clamor pela reinvenção artística. A faixa título consegue reunir em si os elementos fundamentais da Fama.
iconic pop debut. a pop QUEEN. the best pop album of the 2000s. she did for the gays.
This album introduced us to Lady Gaga who will actually become one of the biggest names in music. Best debut album in the history of pop music. I said what I said. Periodt.
Toda una biblia Dance, sin duda arte puro, desde su debut demostrando que nació para ser una estrella
1.- JUST DANCE.- EXCELENTE primer sencillo, un giro fresco al pop del 2008, como primer track del album me parece un poco de golpe, pero definitivamente es una canción memorable dentro de su carrera. TOP2.- LOVE GAME.- De esas canciones que al escucharlas cuando el disco es lanzado dices "Ojalá sea sencillo" sigue la linea de la anterior, ambas bastante comerciales. Hasta ahora vamos muy bien. TOP3.- PAPARAZZI.- En esta canción Gaga nos va introduciendo de a poco su lado teatral/ freak, en la época no me gustó como sencillo pues su sonido varía un poco de los anteriores, un pop un poco menos agresivo y comercial, pero ahora me parece una obra de arte. TOP4.- POKER FACE.- Volvemos a la linea del pop comercial, un poco más agresivo. Definitivamente un sencillo que marca una era en la historia del pop. En esta canción Gaga también nos va introduciendo de a poco detalles característicos de ella como el "mamamama" fraseos más abstractos fuera de lo común dentro del pop de la época. TOP5.- EH, EH (NOTHING ELSE I CAN SAY).- El lado dulce y fresco del album. Un sonido más 90's, muy distinto a las anteriores canciones pero no deja de ser comercial. Con esto Gaga aleja al album de ser monótono, Líricamente bastante simple pero necesario para el transcurso de la experiencia The Fame. No es mi favorita pero tampoco la odio.6.- BEAUTIFUL DIRTY RICH.- Sónicamente es un vuelco 180° al sonido del disco, bastante aire a Mark Ronson. No es para nada una mala canción pero definitivamente rompe con la homogeneidad del sonido previo. Podemos ver también un poco más de la personalidad de Gaga. No es mi favorita pero tampoco la odio.7.- THE FAME.- Otro sonido muy distinto a las 6 anteriores. Un poco más de influencia Rock. Me da la impresión de que los anteriores sencillos fueron solo la herramienta para saltar la fama y en estas canciones empezamos a oir a la verdadera Gaga. Me deja un ligero sabor a poco.8.- MONEY, HONEY.- La pista me suena muy similar a Just Dance, es como si la hubiera reciclado y eso me suena a RELLENO. De todos modos no es una canción recordable.9.- STARSTRUCK.- Un sonido bastante mas similar a los primeros tracks. Inicialmente de mis canciones favoritas del disco. La colaboración con Flo Rida me parece lo menos Gaga que he escuchado en mi vida, sin embargo pienso que debió ser sencillo. TOP10.- BOYS, BOYS, BOYS.- Retomamos la linea del pop comercial. Tiene potencial de sencillo también intentando recuperar cohesividad en el álbum. TOP11.- PAPER GANGSTA.- El principio suena a un rap con auto tune. Sigue en la linea de los anteriores dos tracks. Líricamente un poco más trabajada, también nos va introduciendo de a poco su inclinación por el piano. No es mi favorita pero tampoco la odio.12.- BROWN EYES.- Primera balada y ME ENCANTA! Otro giro completamente distinto a lo que iba del disco. De nuevo vuelvo a pensar que todo lo anterior fué solo un parche comercial para saltar a la fama y en estas canciones vemos realmente el potencial artístico de Gaga. TOP13.- I LIKE IT ROUGH.- Volvemos al pop pero bastante menos agresivo que los anteriores, me suena bastante Madonna y no a sus mejores canciones, nada recordable. Relleno innecesario. NEXT14.- SUMMERBOY.- De nuevo otro giro muy distinto al sonido. Otra mezcla un poco rock, me suena un poco a Katy Perry! Creo que jamás había escuchado algo asi de Gaga. No es para nada mala, de hecho me suena muy para escucharle en el auto y me gusta!15.- DISCO HEAVEN.- Continua con la influencia un poco rock, pero esta vez me suena un poco a relleno. Innecesario. NEXTEN GENERAL: Como primer álbum no me parece malo pero sónicamente no me suena NADA cohesivo. Suena a un experimento de sonidos. Un poco como si fuera una Gaga bohemia artista de bar queriendo salir en algunas canciones, luchando contra una disquera que quiere repetir el éxito comercial que tuvieron los primeros dos sencillos. Un par de rellenos innecesarios. No es un mal álbum pero tampoco mi favorito.
This was lady gaga's debut and one of her best albums and probably one of the best pop albums ever made.
This is and always will be one of mother monsters best album to be released, with LoveGame being one of the songs in my top 3 favorite songs ever made right with Pink Floyd’s “Time” and Gaga’s “Bad Romance”. Still have to decide what order to put them in.
This album is unforgettable! The birth of one of the most iconic artists of the millennium! We'll never forget the smash-hit "Poker Face". Amazing album, amazing artist, and an amazing debut.
For me it's the biggest debut album in the history of POP. Poker Face is the highlight of this album. Paparazzi gave us Lady Gaga's best performance. Nothing could compare.
Plsss, literally the best way to start gher career. Literally bop after bop, this album can´t be topped.
The way she started her career was (and still is) so Iconic!!! Bops on bops.
True break to the traditionally. This album is filled with soulful pop songs. This album is massively apart of my childhood.
Hit after hit after hit. A really enjoy this album every time i listen to it thoroughly. I mean, did you see how mane song the wrote for this record or before this album came out. there are so many unreleased songs. She worked so hard for her debut and she got what she deserved
DIOSA, desde este album me enamore de su musica, porque es la unica artista que me llena completamente, ritmos impresionantes y demostrando todo lo que ella puede ofrecer al mundo de la musica.
The Best hits of Lady Gaga...................................................
Lady Gaga is a gorgeous and talented artist and her debut album was very successful and made her way to Hollywood. The title of the album predicted that the album will gain fame and Gaga herself will receive it. The songs just dance poker face paparazzi were super successful. The album was made in the style of 90 and early 00, and it was a good decision, as if she did in the same style as she would not have been able to achieve such heights. Unfortunately the album can be divided into 2 parts. These are the first 6 good songs and 9 bad songs that either did not fit into the style of the album or were already rigidly outdated.Videos filmed for singles have become icons in the music industry. They were as desny as poker, as grim as the paparazzi, or who just got into a dance. The clips were extravagant inspired by the scandalous clips of Britney Spears and Madonna. This is how the clips hooked people. A truly great album
Gli ottimi esordi di Lady Gaga, musica promettente che ha aperto la strada a un artista di spessore.
La biblia del pop vigente, sin dudas marcó un antes y un después en la cultura pop, la llegada de Lady Gaga a la música fue lo más importante en la industria musical actual.
The Fame (2008): O primeiro álbum da cantora Lady Gaga chega com uma ótima produção e com os belos vocais da cantora. Nota: 8.8
this album has fresh sounds and makes me dance everywhere. The hits are memorable.
Uno de los mejores álbumes debut de la historia. Tiene canciones míticas en su carrera como Just dance, paparazzi o poker face y aunque el sonido de algunas canciones ya se ha pasado un poco de moda, sigue sonando igual de bien. Es divertido, pegadizo, fresco e innovador y con este disco consiguió su objetivo de revivir el fenómeno pop de masas.
Just amazing! I love every single sonf on that album!! Her first album couldnt have been any better
This is the born of the biggest artist in all human history, every single person needs to listen and pay attention to it. Baby just dance is perfect
Literaly, A Star is Born. I shouldn't be so surprise that Lady Gaga's first album is one of her master pieces. She brings us the dance music and made it commercial but so artistic at the same time.
one of the best debut albums in history, the fame brings a legacy of pop rebirth and making it more important, Lady Gaga meets all the requirements and brings something else with her and this is the extravagance that defines her since this era
A lot of dance music, with a lot of energy. Lady Gaga was born with that record and it was a beautiful way to do it,
Dio justo en el blanco con este album, es perfecto para ser su debut, se nota el tiempo que le dedico
Amo a Lady Gaga, su música es inspiración profunda #LadyGaga #TheFame #TheFameMonster
Este álbum, refleja como una persona puede llegar a sentirse una diva, empoderada, cosa que no es malo, en cierto modo en un momento de su vida, uno debe sentirse insuperable, este álbum refleja eso y mucho mas, bailable, fiestero, cool, eso y mucho mas refleja, adoro este álbum ❤️
lady gaga revolutionized the pop industry with this album. absolutely amazing
un álbum sólido y adecuado para su debut. con este álbum lady gaga hizo que su carrera empiece con el pie derecho, logrando hits y siendo reconocida mundialmente. el concepto usado para este álbum es realmente bueno, al igual que la mayoría de sus canciones. los feats no se sienten forzados y quedan re bien. mis canciones favoritas son the fame, boys boys boys, money honey, beautiful dirty rich y just dance
Primera música que gaga trajo al mundo. Se podría decir que es el álbum más Stefanni de todos.
Just Dance ! Just Dance ! Just Dance ! Just Dance ! Just Dance ! Just Dance ! Just Dance ! Just Dance ! Just Dance !
Standout Tracks: I like it rough, Poker Face, Paparazzi, Summerboy, Eh Eh Nothing Else I can Say
I like it Rough would have been a beautiful choice as an official single and I really like the production direction of its track.
Paper Gangsta is one of the standout tracks from this debut album and greatly shows the potential of Lady Gaga.
entrou arrombando tudo e todos, obra divina e criação perfeita. um dos melhores álbuns do seculo
Literally one of the most impactful and generally best debuts out there !!!
With her debut album, Gaga shows us that she knows how to make a hit, but still failures in delivering cohesion.Top Track: Poker FaceWorst Track: Paper Gangsta
The best Debut Album of all time. This album is such a masterpiece and very work of art.
As faixas são brilhantes e icônicas, temos certeza que vamos ouvir essas músicas por muitos anos, os vocais são incríveis e melodias memoráveis.
Pretty Solid. The album is built on a in-depth context that is the Fame. Songs complement each other as a full album. We can see Gaga hiding behind an avant-garde persona, but the deep cuts like Brown Eyes and Summerboy reveal the more natural side of her. The production is pretty catchy, the lyrical content is on point for a commercial success aimed album.
“The Fame” is the biggest and most impactful debut album of the century so far and wil never ever be outdated
Although the birth of electronic dance pop and a moment on the music industry, it isn't the best critically speaking. It certainly defines what the pop scene would look like for the following decade, the album is pretty empty outside of it's singles. Very few songs besides the ones promoted are memorable and the majority of the album lacks personality or depth. And no, the ballad doesn't help it more than it pushes the record back.
This album literally changed pop culture one sequin at a time. She really paved the way for many artists and continues to set trends before anybody else!
Queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
Great album! Really fun and danceable tracks. Deserved the Grammy. My favorites are Just Dance and Paparazzi.
A Gaga sabe escrever melodia, hein? Amo todas apesar de achar as músicas vazias demais, mesmo sendo pra pista de dança e isso acaba tirando todo o potencial que o álbum tem. Faixas como The Fame, Brown Eyes e money honey são as mais fracas e as maiores, quase todas, são singles. Ainda assim, a interpretação vocal e a variedade sonora dentro dos padrões de estética e produção do álbum ainda assim são curiosas o suficiente para te levar até o fim. Divertido e dançante, teatral e brilhante, o álbum se destaca por conhecer seu público (principalmente da época) mas é óbvio que se torna uma potência quando se junta todo o resto que o rodeia: moda, vídeos musicais e promoção.
Iconic beginning of an album, with familiar synths and and intro containing what we need to know about the album: "RedOne, Konvict, Gaga". "Just Dance" is definitely one of the best songs that Gaga had written, since beside being a production masterpiece, it talks about enjoying your life no matter what, just remember to just dance - it's gonna be okay! "LoveGame" is a really cool, welcoming song about sex. I love the execution, and I'm glad that Gaga used those more confident vocals, rather than those weak vocals from the demo. "Paparazzi" is a nice, bright pop-y song, with, well, questionable lyrics, but they fit the theme of the album well + Gaga slayes vocally. "Poker Face" is another production masterpiece. Not only the beat is incredible, but all the details put into that song, like those little "a-a-a" backing vocals behind the song's chorus - I love them so much! And song's theme - bisexuality - is really relatable for me. "I Like it Rough" takes as to other planet, possiblly even to Chromatica, because this song sound so pink for me. Definitely one of the best pre-ARTPOP era vocals are here, with that cool production."Eh, Eh", even though it shares the same producer as the previous track, is completly different - it's vibrant and much more bright and less synth-y. "Starstruck" is another song following album's theme - the fame - this time, how do we feel next to big celebrities. I love this twinkly production of this track, but it's kinda repetetive, but it's not a much of an issue. "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" let Gaga's raw vocals shine with really intricate production details, especially on song's chorus. "Vanity" is simply addictive with its hook, and should be included in every edition of album - it makes so much sense. The next is album's title track - "The Fame". Containing this bright and synthy production with really nice lyrics, you simply cannot be in love with this track."Money Honey" definitely is one of the simplest tracks out there because of its production, which is kinda same-y as album's hugest singles, but it's still worth checking out, especially with an extended intro! "Boys Boys Boys" is a lovely song about boys. But that's not why I love it so much, again it goes down to the sound of the song - it features really cool details of Gaga's backing vocals, and production work is really nice! "Paper Gangsta" is kinda change of pace for an album, featuring more serious Gaga, with quite different production choices. Gaga's voice is auto-tuned, while the track is backed-up by piano and this hip hop beat. The song makes sense within an album due to its subject matter - how Gaga got scrapped from Def Jam. "Brown Eyes" starts the streak of slower tracks at the end of the album. It's a powerful piano ballad, which I really adore. "Summerboy" is playful, and besides that I wouldn't shift Gaga's vocals so much, I have nothing else to add about this one."Disco Heaven" is retro-disco track inviting you to some old club - I like it. "Retro Dance Freak" isn't really great, and definitely there were much better choices for song to put on the album insted of this auto-tune retro track talking, well, about Gaga herself. I wish that "Freakshow" was put here instead - the song would make so much sense in this album, due to being somewhat about the fame. Or "Quicksand", which had really cool, matching production. "Again Again", depending on an edition, is in the middle or at the end of the album. I guess it would be better to left it at the end, but wih addition of "Wonderful" after, since "Again Again goes seamessly into "Wonderful", and they're both about the same person - its producer and Gaga's ex - Rob Fusari.Production-wise this album is very cohesive, that's why I'm giving it 10/10, because to be honest how album feels to me matters to me the most. Lyrcial content can be just a cool bonus, and here are two major themes - relationships and the fame, which comes together in tracks like "Money Honey" or "Beautiful Dirty Rich", so I'm taking it. Gaga really opened-up her career at the highest standards!
it’s a cultural reset, a reason to breathe. it’s the reason why I wake up, the reason why I eat, the reason why I live. it’s everything that gives me energy, everything that gives me strength, everything that i’ve ever wanted.
The most impactful and iconic and legendary debut album in the history of humanity. No one has come close to top this album and it remains a true inspiration to artist all over the world. It’s just amazing how everything Gaga does is pure gold. A pop bible.

Fueled by heavy dance tracks and popping electronic beats, «The Fame», the first album by the glamorous Lady Gaga, is a well-crafted sampling of feisty anti-pop in high quality. This full-length album proves she's more than one hit and a bag of stage tricks. Drawing on ’70s disco and ’80s electro pop for the 12 tracks that make up «The Fame», Gaga writes deluxe ditties that compel the listener to “just dance”. Empty lyrics are all part of the game when it comes to creating pop music — and Lady Gaga looks to have hit the jackpot here with her blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting.
What an amazing debut. I really enjoyed this album. Congrats Gaga!Highlights: Just Dance, LoveGame, Poker Face, Beautiful, Dirty, Rich, The Fame and Money Honey.
The debut of the biggest superstar of all time, the supernova of the 21 century!
This is what the industry NEEDS!!!! POP REVIVAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Culture reset diye kullanilan terim sanirim Lady Gaga'nin The Fame albumune tam uyacaktir. Just Dance, Love Games, Paparazzi, Poker Face ve hatta The Fame gibi parcalar 2019 sonrasi ciksa sosyal medyanin da etkisi ve ruzgariyla nerelere gelirdi dusunmeden edemiyorum. Her seyiyle harika bir album.
there are couple songs that i can enjoy but this album is my least best lady gaga album.
The best debut album in the history of pop music! No bad songs, only fantastic songs that always get you dancing no matter what mood you in. LUV It!.
Moment when A STAR WAS BORN! Classical definition of debut masterpiece and how artistic mind can be turned into electronic pop music.
Without question, 'The Fame' is one of the greatest pop albums ever and shows how a debut album should be done.
I can't wait 4 the 2009 tour!!! when will Heavy Rotation be released in the u.s????
I love the album !!! it's not her best , but it's really good! my favourite songs are: "You'll Be Fine" , "The Way I See It" , "Heavy Rotation" , "Defeated" , "Beautiful Messed Up World" i don't like "Never Gonna Love Again".
Anastacia doing what she does best!! a true diva, an amazing voice and a good album!
i just love her soooooo much!! i'm so happy that she's back!
It's quite various, that's the main reason i like it.
Love the album.
Anastacia is Back and as Amazing as always!!
I give it a 7 ! i really hope she releases an album in 2010!!! love her she's the best.
Not her best album, but still very good! a true Diva!! can't wait 4 the next one which i hope will be better!
After being a anastacia fan FOR VERY LONG TIME, this is one of her best albums.. for me it's a little disco, dance and pop and mixed with a little bit of R&B my favorite is the single 'I can feel you', 'absoultely positviley', 'heavy rotation' & 'you'll be fine'', 'you'll be fine' reminds me of Secrets of the 'Freak Of Nature' album, anyway if you don't have it in your collection or digital BUY IT!!!!!!!!
I love : "you'll be fine" "the way i see it" "heavy rotation" "beautiful messed up world" "same song" "defeated" it's a good album all in all! it could have been better..... but it is what it is ! i love Anastacia!!!!
An amazing album from a stunning woman with an even more stunning voice! she definatly doesnt siaapoint once again!
Absolutely Wonderful!
She's Back!!!
Bom álbum, mas infelizmente não foi o bastante para Anastacia fazer impacto nos Estados Unidos. É visível que esse era o objetivo do álbum, visto a pegada R&B, o que não combinava com o passado de Anastacia no pop/rock. Talvez o problema tenha sido o fraco carro-chefe, "I Can Feel You", produzido pelo produtor que na época era do momento: Ne-Yo.
Does this album is the beginning of a drastic descent. I have the impression that Electric Six starts to repeat itself a little too much and lack of originality and good melody. A little disappointing for a group that I considered a revelation for their style. At least, there is 1 or 2 good songs throughout the album.
This is a good album, but "I shall exterminate everything around me which prevents me from being the master" (thier 4th, non-metacritic'd album) is better. Also, you should go see them live, as they're one of the best live bands on the planet.
Doll domination has potential in terms of lyrics and rhythms is not all bad but I would like to listen more to those of more dolls
Aside from a few songs, the Pussycat Doll's Domination falls incredibly short. The few songs that garnered public notice and made the albuma success are the only pieces on the album that are able to hold their own. In an album full of guest appearance and stylized pop beats, it seems the pussycat dolls are out of steam... yet again.
Listening to this album is like having your soul sucked out. Aside from When I Grow Up, there is almost nothing good. In fact, the safer tracks on the album are all stale and boring. Sifting through 23 songs, I've found 7 that are ok, and one that's great. And I say this as someone who loves their first album. It was fun and effortless, part cool and new, and part cool and retro. Doll Domination, on the other hand, sounds laboured. It wouldn't be so bad if they knew how to make cuts, but instead they put everything they recorded out there, and if you want all 8 listenable songs, you have to get the deluxe edition. What a disappointment!
UMM.....aLL I can Say is WHat An Album. Now dis time i spended my money well. i mean come on now don't be jealus, its the best group of songs i'd ever heard. be more generous and give em credit cuz its an Excellent album and at least each doll has their own solo song. And THey are One of the best dancing groups ever. but I can say that its unfair to the other dolls dat nicole gets all the lead. I noe if dis time around all of dem sang at least each of the soongs den it would had been more successful. I LOVE PCD!!!!!!!!!
Being a huge fan of the Dolls for many years now and i can honestly say i am not disappointed. Sure it's note revolutionary or even going to leave much of a mark in POP/RnB history, but for what it is, fun, breezy, and overwhelmingly catchy, for me that's all i need to get me through the day. Don't forget they are a whole package aswell, Great singers, Phenomenal dancers and great entertainers. Go PCD!!!
How can an album, like this pile of sh*t, have an average of 51?! This album is a shame! First: it's not a Pussycat Dolls' album, it's a Nicole's one. Next: the songs are so KITSCH, bad, ... (The only one who's "so so" is "When I grow Up"). The rest is to burn! Believe me: just don't buy it! Only if you want to kill your ears, the most precious things (with the eyes. To see girls like Nicole dancing on the streets?!)
I can't wait for the Dolls to hit #1 and shut all you criticizing jealous jerks up!
Amazing songs. Amazing vocals. A great album overall!
This is really great album. I know that some hate it...for reasons that I don't understand. I actually love every trach on this album. Good job PCD!!
I really have no idea why critics hate this album and the girls too. Sure, Nicole sings on almost every track and we don't hear the other girls but it's still a pretty good album with solid tracks and something for everybody. I don't know why critics miss that point. Not a bad album, good, but not great.
This album is not really that bad as most critics say! Its quite decent actually. I like the first 12 tracks and after that there are about 3 lifeless offerings. That's it! The production is spot on and the songs are quite distinct from each other in style. If your a fan of fun albums and disposable hip hop, then check it out! If your looking for serious hip hop album....keep looking.
Amazing album! Only weak song on this album is Out Of This Club, but the dolls sing absolutely amazing! Queens of Pop! Nicole, Ashley, Kimberly and Jessica legends! Melody is petty for not returning. DOLL DOMINATION!!
Prefeito do início ao fim, Takin Over The Word e Out Of This Club, mereciam vídeos
Doll domination has potential in terms of lyrics and rhythms is not all bad but I would like to listen more to those of more dolls
This album is amazing! So many good lyrics and messages. I like that we can see more of the soft side of the Dolls and still be able to dance with them. Def need more of **** Dolls soon.
Really love this album. everything is so good, the songs, cover, names, features. When I Grow Up is such a bop.
A perfect album by the greatest girl group. All of the songs are on point, whenever we listen to them it gets us anxious about what's comin next from the girls
Literally so many bangers in one album aaand heartfelt songs. Love it so much!
one word: this is iconic. a step up on pop music. nicole's amazing vocals are here and the lyrics are brilliant. the best pop album of 2008
Best album ever. No skips at all, absolutely flawless. Timeless as well, still listening over 10 years later and it feels fresh!
Best album. PCD was amazing with covers and amazing sexy songs, but this album made me dancing then sitting back and wiping a tear. AMAZING WORK GIRLS. Luv you: Ash, Jess, Mel, Nic, Kim. and of course Carmit.
my fave album ever!!!! i’m so in awe of their talents. they all inspire me so much and i can’t even begin to describe how much of an impact this album has
I love it, all of the songs is so damn good, a lot off bop, a perfect pop!!!!! Always on repeat
An amazing record!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think it's a great album.
How can this be a chemicalbro' compilation without The Test, one too many mornings and alive alone? the bonus disc is makes up for the lacking tracklist and the shitty new hiphopsong keep my composture though. Great band, bad compilation.
The Chemical brothers best work all one disk - sometimes it's easy to forget how many classic tracks these guys have put out. From Galvanise to Setting Sun, Block Rocking Beats to Hey Boy Hey Girl, all the smashes are here sounding as vibrant and energetic as they did when they first hit the airwaves. Some great collaborations on it.
This is yet another great album from Bajofondo. The variation (from rap to progressive styles) in the music sounds great altogether and the subtle electronic influence makes the music flow perfectly, making it a sweet, soothing ride from the beginning to the end. Very, very recommended.
The best album of the year until now. The mix of tango and electronic music with the addition of great singers gives as result a memorable album.
Interesting how it's got an 84 overall rating, with no individual rating higher than an 80.
I dont understand the mixed user reviews here. There is more depth and creativity in this album than most chart artist struggle to put out in a whole career.
Just try to be still and listen to this. And lyrics? You can't rate this low just because you don't like the genre. Punk Disco Awesome.
This is a fantastic surprise and an early candidate for album of the year.
It´s an amazingly fun album to listen. Fun, deep at times, and well-done.
Decent but clearly overrated. I actually liked Antony's vocals here more than on his solo debut, but a lot of these songs start to run together, especially toward the end. Still, some great stuff, especially "Blind."
Great album... "Blind" is amazing!
I am not the biggest fan of electronic dance music but I still find this album to be hard not to stop listening to with tracks like "hercules theme" and "iris".
The fact that the tunes are worth listening to as well as dancing to make all the difference to me.. I used to hate house music or whatever they played at the disco's because they did nothing for my mind to make my body want to move. The songs which are co-produced with Antony of Antony and the Johnsons are my favorites.
It took me a few listens to get used to it. Now I like it. It's weird: I really cannot stand Antony's voice, and I utterly despise the music from Antony and the Johnsons, but whenever he's a gues vocalist, I usually like him. On DULL FLAME OF DESIRE, on the Bjork record, his voice meshes so well. And I loved it. Now here, with the unlikely electronica/disco background, it meshes well yet again. This is disco. "Hercules' Themese" is a brilliant instrumental with some backing vocalizations that sound like a woman's chorus. "Athene" is pure, cool, neon-hued fun. "Blind" is an extremely cool song, the vocal overdubs are so astounding, the music is really great too. The only misstep for me is "Iris" which fails to grab my attention. The main problem with these songs, that lurks on all but two ("Athene" and "Blind"), is that they go on for too long. Theres multiple points in the song where I caught myself saying "that would have been a good ending," but it went on. Sometimes repeating the same thing for a minute. It just gets monotonous after a while. As does the whole album. I can't listen to it in whole very often, I usually stop in the middle of "Easy." The songs don't differ enough from each other for me to sit and venture through all of its 45 minutes. Yet still, as it is, this is a very good album. I got used to it and I'm glad I did.
First of all, I am not one of those people who just read a few good reviews and on a whim bought this album. I am a fan of about roughly 60% of the artists on the DFA label, and I also really love electronic music (as I'm sure most of you do) , but I hadn't really read a bunch of the hype until I had already listened to the album. Is the hype worth the results? Hehhh..."Time Will" is just aiight, "Hercules Theme" through "Blind" is fucking awesome. "Iris and "Easy" are easily the 2 worst tracks on the album and really prevent this album from being a front-to-back classic that so many people are saying it is. Actually my favorite songs may be the last 3. "This is My Love" is my personal favorite song on the album and the only other track that competes with "Blind" just on a pure ear-candy experience. "Raise Me Up" has just wonderful vocals by Antony and "True False/Fake Real" is probably tied as my 2nd favorite song on the album, although at the beginning it sounds a lot like LCD Soundsystem, it really develops in a way I wasn't expecting. I wouldn't say this album is gonna change the face of dance music or anything like that (like Pitchfork essentially did), but besides 2 tracks, every song on here is really strong, addictive dance music with really unique and beautiful vocals. If you are already a fan of what DFA is about, you will most likely really enjoy this album.
If you thought Antony had strength on I am a Bird Now, Hercules and Love Affair will blow you away. It's all quality, but his tracks are the cream. A brilliant album that works on multiple levels.
Very good first listen. Iris, and Athene are the only ones I replay though.
Spot on interpretation of dance music over the past 25 years, with a modern feel, and lots of genuine emotion. Sad irony is that Moby's new album made a similar attempt but is not nearly as slick.
The music isn't about the sexuality, so don't give it a lower rating because it was too "ghey". I think it's a gorgeous, organic album that the music industry needed. It was like a really classy Scissor Sisters album.
Not really following why the average user score for this is only a 6. Too many white guys who have still not got over the whole 'disco sucks' thing from 30 years ago?
What a great album. I love the transition about half-way through from technical disco ("You Belong", "Time Will") to something that's hard to describe...a slow, electrosynth version ("Iris" and "Easy") The layers of Hegarty's voice is amazing in this, and Cruz stands up fairly strong as well when being juxtaposed with a voice as unique as Hegarty's. Butler deserves all the credit in the world with the production on this, especially in "You Belong" and "Easy", which are highlights imo. Great album. My only complaint is that it gets progressively weaker after "Easy" imo.
Aweshum. The people who rated this 3 or 4 because it sounded like disco, you people are crazy. It's not really disco, it's somewhere between that and the late 80s Talking Heads. Original and fresh from start to finish. Antony's voice is fantastic. The best track, of course, is "Blind" -- give it a listen! Best album of 2008.
Great Album, very well made easy listening electronical music. But to me the only really ingenious song seems to be "You Belong" with the funkiest electronic baseline since daft punk's "Around The World" (in the chorus)
The more I listen to this album the more it grows on me. It's definitely overrated right now, electronic music always seems to get overly praised. That said, this album is definitely worth getting if you enjoy electronic music, or just want something different in the mix.
The album is great. However, Anthony's lyrics drench some of the songs, destroying the vitality of the beats.
I think this album is complete crap. It lacks substance, none of the songs grab you and want to make you want to listen again. It's like a bad combination of The Cure and The Comunards.
Uhm... no.
I am upset that people rated this album a 4 just because it sounds a little like disco. Voting this album low won't change the music! Hercules and Love Affair do something new with their tunes, and i think most will enjoy the fun times in this album!
The most excting album since the beginning 2008! As someone said, this ain't a love affair, it's true love!
Amazing neo disco! It will blow you away!
Disco. No, I mean it, disco. Andy Butler and Antony Hegarty are bringing you brand spankin
I can't understand why this has gotten good reviews. This is annoying dance, disco with annoying singing. Yes, I am white and yes disco still sucks.
Totally boring and flat production with horrible out of tune vocals. Nothing touching or emotional. Nowhere renovational. A real drag to get through. Cant believe why this gets such good reviews. I looked very much forward to this record :-(
Poor. Nothing except for Antony and some catchy-jazzy-funky tunes. I am sorry.
Best Album of 2008! Fantastic!
I never have been able to get used to Antony's voice. The music is astounding, but the vocals will eternally irritate me. (And even if I liked his voice, it doesn't go well with dance music.)
Best album of the year, fantastic!
One of the first must have records of 2008, very very hard to fault
I bought this on the strength of the reviews on this site. Really wished I hadn't.
Sounds catchy and his voice is beautiful but this is awfully ghey stuff.
Cheesy, really really really cheesy euro techno in the worst vein. I got rid of it after one listen.
I have to disagree with the user who described Antony's voice as "...not going well with dance music." What better voice to put over new disco beats than a diverse, deep but androgynous one? He seems more at home here than with the Johnsons.
Dance revolting, enthousiastic, so 80s, 90s and yet so much fresh...music of today, the big surprise from US, sounds european project.
Wow! Great album!
An amazing album from start to finish. Such talent!
Flawless album
PITCHFORK GAVE IT A 9.1! IT MUST BE GOOD.
I don't like disco before this disc.
Sounds pretty good a first, then gets progressively more typical each repeat listen. Over-hyped.
At times I listen to parts of this record and think to my self what in gods name is this doing in my collection, but its almost as if the album hears my doubts and immediately moves to reassure me. At 10 tracks, its just long enough to make its point without losing focus. The record is pure pop that ,although doesn't necessarily sound like it, has a distinct underground feel. Largely inspired by the 80's, it takes the best of the synth pop bands of that decade and makes something new with it. Their cover of PIL's Public Image is the highlight of the record which in some ways takes away from the album as on this track you get a direct comparison to what they are trying to emulate and their own material comes up short next to this classic track. Overall well worth checking out if your open minded.
Una joya total, esto merecía ser tan exitoso y masivo como lo fue She is so Unusual ya que cada canción suena a un potente hit y es muchísimo mejor que Hard Candy (Madonna), The Fame (Lady Gaga) y One of the Boys (Katy Perry), los cuales salieron al mercado el mismo año.
Her best album since her debut. Into the nightlife will definitely be a dance hit and could possibly be her first chart hit since I Drove All Night.
Best cd I've heard so far this year. Love it!
Fantastic! Great fun pop songs with great mixes, beats and sense of fun. Her voice is superb!
it's a rhytmic album folks; it's not meant to be marketed as a dance album...cyndi states it's a record with a lot of rhythms. Grab a Hold and Rain on Me rekindle the unusual/true color days. it's a treasured gem like Hat Full of Stars.
A great surprise. Maybe two or three songs need some remixes to be improved. Same Ol' story and High and mighty are too long. My favourites songs are Set your heart, Rain on me, Rocking chair and Same Ol' story as well. Anyway the album is wonderful.
I love it!!!!!!
Her best since her epic debut. Practically no fillers here. People who like good song-writing combining meanigfull lyrics and catchy melodies will without doubt be addicted to this album.
WOW!!! This album is in my top 5 so far this year, what a nice come back.
Amazing, Cyndi's back!
Absolutely one the best Cyndi Lauper album to date.
Best album in 2008. Great songs, sound, voice and lyrics.
Great CD and great songs. Cyndi is the best. The pop and rock queen knows what she is doing. Great vocalist and great lyrics. Best cyndi!
This ablum is the ablum Madonna wanted to make. It makes you wanna dance while giving you someithing to think about, without being preachy. I love to different styles and sounds on the album, Unfortunately my favorite song on the whold album is one of the bonus tracks "Can't Breathe" it is truly one of the most beautiful haunting ballads Cyn has ever done. But it's all about getting you up on your feet and Bringin' ya To The Brink. So I guess that only makes sense. Dance you will with terrific electro moments like Grab a Hold, and Into the Nightlife. I Say try it you might like it.
The best ever...lyrics and voice! She ever found her way...no matter what people say. Not a product...just a great singer and composer.
Cyndi Lauper has a great voice and she is still unusual. This new album is a return to the her beginning: fun!
The best! Great album!! Surround and power sound! Simply I love Bring ya to the bring!
Cyndi takes on all comers of the dance music world, fusing trance, house, pure pop, R'nB effortlessly, and while some of the really full on hi-energy leaves me a bit cold, the album is a great antidote to the over-egged oap in crotch tight spandex.
This woman has the most incredible vocals ever! Cyndi's music has always gets the top slots in my CD racks!
The new Cyndi's fulldance album is a surprise. Never expect the 80's sound revival so welldone like in "Rain on Me" and "Raging Storm" (a lost Pet Shop Boys discotrack).
This is the best cd of the summer SONY deserves its financial problems if they do not promote the hell out of it will do everything for Cyndi that SHINE should have!
Awesome!!!! The Queen has returned!
Finally good stuff from Cyndi Lauper to listen to with great pleasure. This cd will bring her news young fans, not just the old ones from the eighties!
I've had the honor of knowing Ms. Lauper for many years. She is incredibly talented and a true artist. This album is one of her best. Among my favorites are "Raging Storm" and "Rain On Me", a haunting ballad reminiscent of "Time After Time". Please support her by buying this album. I assure you it will quickly become one of your favorites.
This is a wonderfull album. of course is not the same as a confessions on the dance floor. at least cyndi is more original she didn´t use any sample cover for any of her songs. and she can sing, we cannot say the same of Madonna.
Sounds like a newer version of she's so unusual, new vibe and very up to date. My younger friends are enjoying it, their comments were "and who would of thought? Cyndi Lauper?
Awesome return...puts Kylie and Maddie to shame...learn ladies learn!! ...One or two minor fillers but allowed for in scoring by containing some absolute scorching soon to be classic top toons... All bow before the altar that is Ms Cyndi.
Great Album! The best in the 2008!!
One of Lauper's best albums yet. Such a shame it didn't do as well as it should have. :(Oh well, that's the music buisness for you. Personally my fav track is Into The Nightlife.
Such an amazing album, not just catchy it has meaning, every song has it's very own soul and the beats are so special, Into The Nightlife is such an incredible song.
Completamente inovador e a frente do seu tempo, queria mais músicas pop e eletro assim
A surprising release and a rebirth of the artist. Lyrics are fun, the production is on point, and Lauper sounds as young as ever. Highlights: "Into the Nightlife", "Echo", "Same Ol' F*ckin' Story".
This album was almost... a complete peice of trash. I don't know how stuff like this gets good ratings, but I cannot argue against the system. As for the review: Awful lyrics, childish and non imaginitive, things rhyme but they are not even clever and some fail to make sense. It isn't even art anymore. The music is simple and... I ll just say it now, There just is not anything "great" about this album.
Utterly and completely over-rated.
Overrated!
Konichiwa Bitches is fantastic. One of my favorite songs. Unfortunately, the rest of the album sucks.
Are you guys kidding me? the first time i think i saw her or heard of her was on letterman and she absolutely positively sucked... so either this is completely overatted, or she sucks. I think its a combination of both.
really overrated, and very arrogant, boring, self-important lyrics. Some good songs, check it out.
Great songs from start to finish, it's one song that i skip, but it isn't really bad TBH. Lyrics are on point and I don't like it when a popsinger raps about a serious matter. Robyn choosed to rap, but rapped in a funny way. 10/10
Really the best pop album of the last 20 years. It's Robyn's "Like a prayer". Definitely worth the wait. I guess this is what happens when musicians care more about artistry than money.
This is the best pop album of the 2000s. Seriously. Every song could be a single. Every ballad is heartbreaking. Every uptempo jam kills. If you are a fan of pop music, this is the must have album of 2008.
Probably one of the best albums that's in my CD case. Doesn't matter when I decide to put it on, it always sounds great! The one thing about Robyn is that she doesn't have a strong voice. But her emotion behind her voice conveys to every song on the album. Especially "Handle Me", "With Every Heartbeat", "Be Mine" and "Dream On". You can actually feel that she means it. As a person who heard her in the 90's, and that's it, it's refreshing to know that there is pop music out there that actually has meaning. Kudo's, Robyn!
One of the best albums of the year. I believe some of the best track were not even released as singles!!!
Totally lives up to the hype and well worth the wait for the domestic release. I'd heard several cuts on YouTube and other places, but was still shocked how consistently strong the whole CD is. Not a clunker in the bunch.
One the best albums ever! AMAZING album!!!
Best pop album of the last 5 years.
Simple, the best pop album I ever listened!!
flawless EVERY single song on this album is g.r.e.a.t! saw her live and show just matched the energy and quality her videos for this album are gems as well FEROCIOUS!!!! :)
This is a good album, no real dissapointments. The songs are very different from one another, Eclipse is a slow acoustic ballad, while anytime you like is a electro ballad. Should have known is a 80's RnB song, while Be mine! is a 80's pop song, and so on and on. This is a eclectic album for eclectic minds. Lyrics are on point as well, ranging from silly towitty to serious.
These guys are all right. If you don't like this album it's 'cause you don't like pop. I know it sounds arrogant, but this album is so well done, Juicy Pop.
Good songs (I especially enjoy 'every heartbeat'...) but let's not exaggerate: it's FAR from being one of the best record of the year!
Brilliant! Robyn has evolved into one of the most interesting artists of the decade.
Very catchy tunes.
Nothing new. Good sound and pretty solid pop, that far goes Robyn. The rest is over used old pop structure, lack of actitud and easy lyrics. Might have been a good cd for the 90s but for 2008 is nice but weak.
Robyn and Annie are rightful heirs to Madonna's pop queen status. Youthful, posturing. . . There's no reason to pretend that artificiality isn't a big part of what makes pop music great, and both musicians demonstrate a very hip strand of artifice. Unfortunately, one of the songs on Robyn's album (which was actually completed in 2005!) reminds me too much of a terrible Kid Rock song. Unnerving. When you consider the pop garbage that teenage girls tend to ingest, these musicians would probably leave a more positive impact, and maybe even a greater interest in music later in life.
THE pop album of the year!!!!!!!
A perfect pop album. Amazingly creative and rich. Poetic, witty, funny. A smash. Robyn is a complete artist. Superior.
I've been listening to this album since it release in Sweden, 2005, and I'm still not tired of it. My favourite is Handle me. Love it!
robyn has brought it. for real. this is seriously the best album i've heard all year, and i expect it will keep that status for the rest of the year as well. i think it speaks to robyn's creativity, musical abilities, and long-lasting appeal that she wrote this album more than 3 years ago, and it still is the newest/best sound out there in pop.
A breath of fresh air! It has completely taken over my Ipod. This is how pop music should be done. Look out for Bum Like You, Who's That Girl & Dream On. Huge Highlights!
Pop perfection! I never thought I would here something so future-forward and fantastic in my lifetime! It's in my top 2 so far this year!!
Just as devastating as it was three years ago, Robyn's new album is one of the strongest pop of the last half of the 2000's.
One of the best pop albums you're likely to hear for quite a while--because it doesn't get lost in itself, take itself too seriously, or throw in "filler"--as most albums these days do. Robyn allows each track to shine on its own, and none disappoints!
I usually don't listen to this kind of music. But this is too good to be missed out. And you'll notice here & there she sings like Kate Bush. So fresh. Bravo.
The best pop album of the last three years. I first heard it upon its original release in 2005 and I'm amazed at its staying power. It still sounds just as fresh and packs as big a punch as it did when I first heard it. Robyn deserves every ounce of praise she receives for this brilliant, sexy, and satisfying record. Both new and old artists should take notes because Robyn has released an album that features pop done right.
Absolute pop perfection. I was nearly moved to tears when I heard it. Madonna is the gold standard of pop, and Robyn is up there with Madonna's best--Robyn's "Robyn" is as flawless as Madonna's "Madonna." She might be best-described as Britney Spears meets M.I.A. Every song is like a gift--they're catchy, fun, provocative, and sound better with each listen. Not only the best album of the last few years, but one of the best pop albums in history.
A stunningly brilliant album. The hits are non-stop. "Konichiwa Bitches," "Crash and Burn Girl," and "Cobrastyle" are energetic party songs, while "Robot Boy," "With Every Heartbeat," "Be Mine!", and "Dream On," are perfectly tender and thoughtful. And that's not even mentioning "Bum Like You," "Handle Me," or any of the other tracks on this album. I don't skip any songs. Every one is a joy to listen to. Quite simply the best album in years.
best POP album of the last few years:D
Fantastic Pitch!
This is absolutely brilliant electropop. Love it.
Yes she has grown with Abba,but there are sick beats here and electronic production that begs for international praise.Not everything is good but it's much better than the average pop album of the 00's
Listened to this twice and have not picked it up since. Dull, dull, dull minus a few passable tracks. What the hell is the big deal? Don't waste your money.
It's really fresh! Amazing! I had lost faith in pure Pop (even if I am not and had never been a great Pop fan), but artists like her or Madonna make great Pop music! Not 10 because of 1 or 2 songs that are kitsch. The rest is very impressive and unexpected!
If you love pop music, which includes danceable beats and catchy lyrics and melodies, you'll LOVE Robyn! It's one of the best albums of 2008 seriously. It's a great departure if you're sick of hearing all the critically acclaimed indie bands taking over, check this out! It's not weird like Animal Collective, and unlike most indie bands and music, it has singles that can top the charts!
Solid ... just totally solid!
Excellent album. THe songs are great and keep you dancing. I have all of robyn's albums and let me tell you...this one brings it home. Check it out if you wanna dance
Definitely a fresh breath of air in pop music. Robyn is a true artist, not your typical manufactured pop dancing machine. She proves indubitably that pop music can have soul, too.
Love the album. Robyn is one of these singers that cares more about the music than fame, money etc. In her songs you can feel the effort she puts into creating them.
In my opinion, Robyn defined herself with this absolutely amazing album for the very first time. With Curriculum Vitae she introduces herself (in a quite exaggerated way) and over the course of listening to the album we get to know her cheeky rapping, her sweet voice as well as some really heartbroken and calm moments she decided to share with us on this album. Special highlights on 'Robyn' are With Every Heartbeat, Crash And Burn Girl and Handle Me.
This self-titled album represents a huge change in Robyn's career, enough to many of her fans calling it her first record and what Robyn really is. And when we listen to it, album really shows why it is her signature record; alternative electro production, interesting lyrics, and so much emotions and creativity.. All for what Robyn is known for and what makes her an electropop legend.
Fantastic considering the worst song on the album was a number 1 Hit!
I really enjoy this record: impressive production, quality song writing and, above all, an amazing Madonna. I had been expecting such quality since Music: no fillers, only potential hits. I was worried the album would sound ordinary, too similar to Nelly Furtado and Gwen Stefany, but the people who say it does have NOT listened to Hard Candy properly: it's a pure Madonna style, with a lîtlle (excellent) Timerberlake urban flavour now and then.
Metacritic's score seems to be a bit skewed towards the negative - I've read lots of positive reviews from reputable sources that aren't included here. it's not at all surprising that places like pitchforkmedia don't like this - they don't want to alienate their hipster indie-rock audience by acknowledging that something good can occasionally come out of the mainstream. for the rest of us who aren't quite so stuck-up, this album is a big old slab of fun. enjoy it for what it is.
I'm in love with this album, it's one of her best. Funky!
I'm really waiting MDNA, because i don't like this a lot. Sure, this is Madonna's worst album. Yes there are good songs ( I think that Miles Away it's fantastic ) but there are bad songs like "Spanish Lesson" and "incredible", too. And this is the first Madonna's album that doesn't have a particular or revolutionary sound. So, a quite good album but when you are Madonna people want from you a great album, not quite good. (sorry for my English)
This album is too cohisive. Some songs (like "Heartbeat" and "Miles Away") could be even better if someone other than The Neptunes would handle those tracks production.
As a huge Madonna fan, I'm disappointed. Never has she sounded more bored and more like a guest on her own songs. Enlisting the help of Timbaland and Timberlake reeks of desperation, and this half-baked effort contains no Madonna classics and only a handful of tolerable songs. Her worst studio effort without question.
I think Madonna lost her way in music with this album. she wamted to try something new but it didn't work. i think R&B beats don't fit on her. the only songs u can bear in this album are "Miles Away" and "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". they sounds like real Madonna. we all expected more from her after her huge success in "Confessions on a Dancefloor".
Hard candy is a rare gem that is full of life and perfection and excellently produced by Timberlake, Timbaland, Pharrell, kanye and The Neptunes. Madonna is at the top of her game with this album and it is one of her better efforts,the noughties are the new eighties for Madonna. tracks-4 Minutes,Give it 2 Me,Miles Away,She's Not Me,Beat Goes On,Dance 2night,Spanish lesson,and Devil are exceptional songs.
Great album. i didn't like 4 minutes at first, but i was only a matter of time so I could like it. My favs: Spanish Lesson, She's not me, Heartbeat, Give it to me, Candy Shop, Beat goes on.
She's now old enough to be a grandma, which is why her childish need for attention and shock is so pathetic... and thanks again for ruining Guy Richie's career.
People seem to have forgotten that this is the maker of Like A Prayer, Ray of Light, Music...I appreciate Madonna likes to change styles with each album she does.. but I simply cannot see anything as stunning and emotionally charged as the mentioned work she has previously done in this album...
wow Hard candy is just the best madonna album ever!!!!!
Creativity is a word out of madonna's vocabulary. The album is irritating, futile, hypocritically innocent and all in one: show of. Is the worst of a
It's not her best album but it is good!
Well, if musicOMH.com and Karen/Brent says Madonna sucks then that must be true, right? Well, no. Sorry to disappoint but that isn't necessarily the case here. First off, let me state for the record that I can't stand Madonna. Everything about her grates me the wrong way but I do have the conviction and the scruples to give someone their dues when...well, it's due. This is a good album because no album that Timberland has been near could ever be rubbish. Except that one had did in the late '90s...when he was still fat. Buy this album so that Madonna can afford that extra black child she's always wanted.
Though same tracks are pretty weak, there are a lot of gems here. They jsn't need some time to shine. It's not an album you'll love on the first listen. I wouldn't even call it a grower. You just need to feel the music, 'cause above all this is a straightforward dance album...
There is more single material rather than a great album full of strong songs Best Songs-4 Minutes,Give It To Me,Heartbeat,Beat Goes On
Excellent!
This album is not as good as Confessions; it doesn't have that album's brilliant combination of back-to-basics dance and the emotional core of Ray of Light and Like a Prayer. However, that being said, Hard Candy is still an extremely enjoyable record, filled with thumping modern beats (see the production credits) and catchy choruses. Anyone who claims that the music and Madonna's personality have been drowned out by the production just isn't giving the album the chance it deserves.
Best pop album so far this year.
NO WAY NEAR AS BAD AS SOME ARE MAKING IT, not better than confessions was but i think the pre-buzz is trying to kill it, really fun party/dance album more 80's vibe than anything she's done recently: CANDY SHOP, GIVE IT 2 ME, MILES AWAY, INCREDIBLE amd DEVIL are my FavEs!!!!!!
There are only about 3 or 4 good songs thanks to her team of producers. Nothing original here. It all sounds what's been on the radio for the past few years. What would Madonna have done through her career without the great record producers she's hired.
Atrocious by anyone's standards. Is incredibly sad to hear her get down to this kind of mess she has been able to avoid for so long.
Fantastic.
Not great. The songs are all generic. She's too old to be singing these kinds of songs.
Excellent! I'm so relieved.
I love it....!!!! Madonna have done a great job again!!!
Don't listen to anyone that says this is not a good album. This is one of Madonna's BEST albums. The majority of the tracks are just awesome, and this album deserves to be listened to with the volume up and the bass pumping! A real crowd pleaser of an album. Fun, exciting, and very danceable.
She hasn't had this fun on an album since Like A Prayer and hasn't gotten as artistic as Ray Of Light.
What can you say to describe this, this is gobsmackingly brilliant, didn't think it would go right but it's a Madonna record at heart! Madonna never lets you down, with every album being a stunner! Love Madonna, she's right up there as one of the best artists of all time, you'll never regret loving Madonna!!!
First album where it doesn't sound like Madonna is calling the shots. She should be ahead of the curve, not following it. No stand out tracks. No intelligence. No good. (And I am a fan).
It's fine, but I feel like I've heard it all before.
Madonna at it's worst. Generic US stuff. Another BigMac but this time unedible even on cnbs. Bedtime Stories crap at least had Human Nature and Bedtime Stories.
Queen of reinvention is desperate. Maybe two ok tracks at best.
it seems Timbaland makes all albums looks like the same thing. For me, Hard Candy is a more pop "loose". Terrible. Madonna is a good singer, but she doesn't need to put sexuality in evidence all time. This is soooo boring. Missing "Erotica" so much.
Great new sound. Perfect follow up to last CD.
Awesome album, every song on it is excellent and I just can't stop listening to it!
Its good, for both fans and typical listeners. Many funky and catchy beats, but its not great and nowhere near as good as some of madonna's other albums.
hard candy is her best album of a decade.
The biggest disappointment of the year! Young stars, such as Adele, Duffy, Estelle and even Britney released much and much better albums. What a shame for Madonna!
It´s a good album, it has excellent tracks, but I think that Madonna could have done something more exciting like Confessións. Anywaysm it has the "MADONNA" seal, and that is guaranteed.
Great album...!!!
Madonna the Best!
Okay people!... Madonna is one of the greatest thing that happened to Pop music... Until 2005's "Confessions on a Dance Floor". Could she be called "Queen of Pop" with an album like Hard Candy?! Not sure. There is no creativity (using the same notes and sounds that Timbaland used in Nelly Furtados and Justin Timberlake's music... They even sound disgusting now!), no sincerity, no re-invention, it's BRAINLESS... There's absolutely nothing special. It would be a great album for Britney Spears, but for Madonna...!? The greatest songs are from co-producer Pharrell Williams ("Give It 2 Me", "She's Not Me", "Incredible" and "Beat Goes On"), and I only credit Timbaland for "4 Minutes".
Far from perfect, I have yet to find any Madonna album that is, Hard Candy is, however very close. Of course it lacks the huge stand out moments that its predecessor had in Hung Up, Sorry and Jump. But it, as a complete album, holds together well, it flows better than any other Madonna album I can think of. The stand out tracks for me are: She's Not Me, Beat Goes On (Feat. Kanye West), Spanish Lesson, Give It 2 Me, Heartbeat and Devil Wouldn't Recognize You. In typical Madonna style, the balladry, is Excellent. In truth the only, and regretably longest, mistake on the album is Incredible, which really shows how weak her voice is if not treated properly. This coupled with the dreadful lyrical content and rather passe beats, it adds up to being the albums only real mistake.
Wow, this is her worst album! :| R.I.P Madonna.
Good enough! A couple of tracks are excellent (Miles Away, Gi2M) but it doesn't come anywhere close to her last album's giddiness.
Amazing! My favorites are Heartbeat, Give It 2 Me, and Devil Wouldn't Recognize You. I haven't stopped playing it for 3 days. I am thrilled and think it's the best dance album in years.
Amazing album!!! One of her best!!!
Atrocious for an artist of her calibre. So dissapointing. 2, maybe 3 decent tracks tops. I love her too.
Her best album in ten years. Catchy, fun and lighthearted.
Not her best, but it's a grower so far. I'm on the 3rd listen and some of the tracks are getting infectious. Some are a bit overdone. Dance2night is adorable.
Every song has something great to offer and you won´t stop dancing...it´s not a producers album. Madonna´s stamp is all over the place.
Simply put: A masterpiece!!!
Amazing album. I think she has the right, after all her years in the record business, to make an album that is just pure fun to listen to, which is what hard candy is all about.
And one more thing... Entertainment Weekly gave this album a B+, how does that factor in as an 83??? The accuracy of this website is definitely questionable.
I love hard candy its her best album.
Great catchy songs
Amazing album...i love it!
Madonna is simply brilliant. Always. I love her stuff with a message, but this is perhaps her best album since "Ray of Light." (And I love the others, so that means something.) It's not as serious, but it's where she is right now and at the end of the day, it's good stuff. "Give It 2 Me," "She's Not Me," "Beat Goes On," "Dance 2 Night," etc. are among her best dance songs. "Devil" and "Voices" are beautiful, and "Miles Away" is perhaps the most gorgeous Madonna song ever. The album's full of good stuff; even the weakest track ("Spanish Lesson") is decent.
This is amazing! It's retro and futuristic at once, and even thou she requested the fashion producers, she didn't become a plastic icon as it happens for 8 of 10 artists when they adventure themselves that side... Go, Madge!
One of the most innovative Madonna album
One of her best in my opinion. Love Give it 2 Me, Beat Goes On, Miles Away, Heartbeat.
Great album...!!!
Awesome work. Probably her best.
One of her best ! The perferct follow-up to "Confessions on a dance floor" ! :>
It¡s fantastic dc, madonna is the queen.
This album is flawless! The production is so layered and constantly surprising. Standout tracks for me are 'She's Not Me', 'Incredible', 'Give It 2 Me', 'Miles Away and 'Devil Wouldn't Recognise You' 10 Out Of 10
FANTASTIC album! One of her most consistent!
Not a bad record, but not great either. After becoming relevant again with Confessions, Madonna has lost some momentum. By the way, folks, perfect scores should be reserved for transcendent works -- this one simply doesn't qualify.
A very good disc that brings Madonna up to date but the album's producers don't leave her the space she needs to be Madonna. Quite fun and easy listening but we demand more.
Let's face it, we've grown to expect more imaginative things from Madonna. But the bottom line is that it's quite a good pop record. Not earth-shattering or genre-bending. Just sugary pop fun. The title says it all.
This is how a pop album should be: no pretensions, no nonsense, with feet-stomping, finger-snapping danceable tunes that would appeal to everyone.
Hard candy is sweet, tasty but have empty calories. Guilty pleasure. It's fun but complitly dispossible. She could have it so much better.
No, it's not the soul-searching journey Ray of Light is, nor is it the amazing space disco odyssey Confessions on a Dance Floor is; however, Hard Candy is a constantly dancable (is that a word?) album that still ranks among her best work, number 5 on my personal list of favorite Madonna albums. It's like she looked back on that girl that was rolling around in a wedding dress at the MTV awards, going back in time, kicking her ass, then drinking her blood while recording the new album. Madonna is just THAT badass. Definitely worth a listen.
Just one decent song(4 minutes).
Madonna successfully integrates the musical styles of her new producers without losing her own sound. "Miles Away, " with its heartbreaking lament, "So far away" is classic Madonna. The song should be her 3rd release after "Give It To Me." Her promotional concert at the Roseland Ballroom confirms the fact that she is simply unrivaled!
This album sucks! Disappointing doesn't even begin to describe it!
For me the album is a perfect hybrid of all the Madonna personas and sounds we've heard over the years but with an up to date vibe....there's RnB,Disco,Electonica,Retro etc etc...there's Bitchy,Fun,Lonely and Self-Reflective....from her vocals to the sound and vibe....a perfect goodbye record to Warner and 25 years Yeap,she's not steps ahead but she has been so many times AND after the block she received from american radio who can blame her for wanting to go mainstream and lighter this time....T-H-I-S is the dance record she set out to make a couple of years ago... The people she worked with this time are as familiar in the music world as her,so people seem to have a hard time accepting their presence or influence.But the record still screams Madonna. i can live without one or two songs but the rest... gems :) Everything she does gets reactions from both extremes but rarely gets apathy,which is always preferable in life....lol. ....which is also another reason to love her! Stop complaining,play the album,dance and enjoy your summer soundtrack!
You must be joking.
Sure it's safe, by Madonna's standard. But like the album "Music," this is a fun record but with lots more potential hits: Beat Goes On, Miles Away, Heartbeat. Pharell's tracks are, surprisingly to me, much better than the Timbaland/Timberlake collaborations.
This cd sounds like Spice Girls without the Spice Girls...So many of the beats remind me of early spice girls songs. I feel like the only way this cd will be decent is through remixes. I guess there's the occasional decent song, but it's really a step down from confessions.
Old-school, funky, as fresh as her first album... just great!!!
Very disappointing...this cd feels forced, like Madonna knows as it goes along that it's just not working...her collaborators have too much leeway, and they're terrible. Timberlake's 4 Minutes is putrid, and why do hip-hop artists feel the need to repeat names a dozen times in songs??..."Madonna...Madonna....Madonna..." so lame it's laughable....Madonna needs to grab the reigns again, these Bozo's ruined this effort. I have no problem with a misstep, I haven't disliked anything from her before this, but I guess her big mistake was letting over-rated drecks take over her album entirely.
So far... Her best work! She's in pop again!
Madonna now adds a new type of sound to her array of styles. "Miles Away" really shines on this album.
She doesn't reinvent the wheel on this one, but the album contains some great tracks.
This is not one of Madonna's stand out albums. It lacks the depth of Ray of Light or the fantastic feel-good moments of confessions; I can think of more stand-out moments for Madonna. Having said that, the album does contain many good songs, highlights being Give It 2 Me, She's Not Me and Beat Goes On. After Confessions, I was expecting something special from the Queen of Pop, but this sadly, despite being co-produced by some of the top producers around, lacks the magic of some of her previous albums.
Its an album which takes time to be appreciated. I now love the album, it has some awesome tunes and some hot beats but it's not a Madonna album. Its not innovative enough, too main stream and too contrived to be a Madonna classic. Its hot, it's no confessions, but its hot. Could do with less JT, shoe doesnt need him.
This album sure is hot!Best songs are Devil wouldn't recognize you,miles away,voices and beat goes on!
The first Madonna album with all that hip-hop, R&B, and dance music experimenting, this CD will make the perfect party going wild.
Okay, so it's not a Confessions, Ray of Light or even Music, but it's great. Madonna's going back to an American radio friendly sound, and she works it out. Usually opting for lesser known producers, Madonna's decision to work with Timbalake and Pharrell left me a little worried. Although their trademark sounds are all over this album, Madonna really makes it her gem, not theirs. Standout tracks for me include Candy Shop, Give It 2 Me, Dance 2night and the breakdown halfway through Incredible.
I was a little worried about whether I would like Hard Candy after the first single, 4 Minutes, was released. Now that I've heard the whole album, I would say that 4 Minutes is possibly the weakest track, and not really indicative of the album as a whole. Hard Candy is being hyped as a kind of R/B/Hip-Hop album, but it's not hip-hop at all. In fact, I would say that this album is what Confessions on Dancefloor was supposed to be: a return to Madonna's 80's club roots. This album actually has more of a retro/disco vibe than Confessions. Stand-out tracks: Heartbeat, Miles Away, Incredible Low points: 4 Minutes, Pharell's singing, and Kanye's lame rap on Beat Goes On
This score is not accurate; the New York Daily News gave it 5 out of 5 stars, and People Magazine gave it 4 out of 4 stars...there are countless other amazing reviews, but this site picks and chooses which ones they're going to use.
Dire one down.
Hot and Jumpin' new and freshly fun
Yes, metacritic forgot to post the great reviews from: Salon.com, About.com, Sputnikmusic, Attitude, the LA times, and the New York Times.... Hmmm....
An excellent CD. True the Madonna form and includes some of the best songs of her career. It's a pity that Metacritic has failed to look more broadly for reviews - you will find some give this record 5/5 and 4/4...but bias will always exist when Madonna is reviewed!!
Absolutely brilliant album! She did it again.
Madonna & hip-hop was never a very successful marriage. And, stubborn as she is, she had to go back again on that road that leads nowhere. When will she ever learn that her niche is, and always was, dance music? And that is why this album compared to her previous masterpiece "Confessions On A Dance Floor", is quite forgettable and bleak.
love it!
Fantastic album. She sounds absolutely rejuvenated. It's refreshing to hear THIS Madonna again after all these years.
this album is off the hook! it's madonna being just down right fun again! i love it!
Such an ordinary album. She uses the same lame gimmicks such as Timberland as a producer, that everyone uses. If those gimmicks had any real talent we might get a good album, instead we get the same mediocre music that floods our bland airwaves and dance floors the last couple years.
It's a very cool just dance and enjoy album, no pretentious kaballah stuff, etc.
Hard Candy is an awesome, eclectic edition of R and B pop fusion. Several of the tracks are irresistible and make you want to dance. Give it To Me alone is worth the album purchase. For Madonna fans everywhere and for those who loved Confessions on a Dance Floor.
Brilliant!
A great companion to CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR! Don't believe the urban slant--this is just great, classic Madonna wrapped in heavier, modern beats. Almost each track is single worthy on this pop album; Madonna should be very proud to have delivered one of her best albums 25 years into her career!
Madonna's worst. Nowhere near as good as Confessions. Whereas Erotica was a brilliant critique/response to modern repressive sexuality, this cd is the singer as a horny old lady, with Justin Timberlake as her studly poolboy. To be blunt, like the pictures in the liner notes, it's kind of gross. Some of the songs are pretty good, rhythmic and funky - but the overall disgusting tone drags the good stuff down.
Production values are superb but the music itself is oddly soulless and vapid. Madonna at 50 is sounding like a 14 year old squeeze box boy toy wannabe, with her nasally register spewing really bad lyrics full of adolescent motivation. Hey, Madonna, grow up already. Cut a record with your brother in law Joe Henry and cut back on all the attempts to be trendy. This album is already 18 years old, sounding ever so much like a downgrade of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation. Sure, some of it is danceable but once the music ends, and believe it's ended on this disc, there's nothing but the sound of a vacuous cash register.
Huge disappointment after the highly enjoyable Confessions.... Madonna is capable of far better than this unoriginal and repetitive drek.
Not impressed- she can do much better than that.
An amazing album with only a few flaws. Spanish Lesson is trite and Candy Shop should have been MIA because it doesn't it isn't as fresh as the rest of the album; some of us have had the track since last summer. LOVE Give It 2 Me and Dance 2night.
I love it.
What happened Madonna? How could you write songs like "Candy Shop," "Incredible" and "Spanish Lesson"? How can you stump to the Justin-clone "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You"? All this sounds so dated and it's all been done in 2006. You're no longer the leader of the pack.
One word - ew.
I'm a big Madonna fan, but this cd is truly disappointing. Somehow I feel like this cd should have been called, "How Madonna Lost Her Groove". Her voice was emotionless throughout, and appeared drowned by the overproduced tracks. I'm hoping that with her next cd, Madonna will do Madonna.
It's quite good actually. It can't be compare with the other albums but sounds very commercial. The lyrics can be very childish ->see "Spanish lesson" but there are also some good tracks. A 9 for this album, I think it worths a 9.
how much more life is there for timbaland beats when will singers start using actual instruments in thier songs ? ... HARD CANDY is no different than Nelly Furtados " Loose" Justins " Future Sex Love Sounds" and Britneys " Blackout" which is no benefit to MADONNA " ConFessions..." was a masterpiece and HARD CANDY is just an atempt to capitalize on the whole urban sound on radio.. ist no disaster just not very original.... UK diva Kylie Minogue " X" had more funk and flare check that out...
Very smart album, lot of hits, US-oriented, hope it will work there.
I'm a fan, but i tend to be critic of Madonna. In this album she manages to balance it all, catching up with today's music, being more mainstreem, and still be herself and delivering to her hardcore fans. The greatest thing is she's having fun and being the feisty Madonna we lost track of for many years!
It's very catchy, vocally she hasn't sounded this good since Ray of Light. It's not anything new, but it's certainly isn't bad.
absolutely amazing album. It's better than Confessions, American Life, Music!
solid, fun summer album. get off your lazy and cynical arses and enjoy it. probably the most straight-up fun album she's put out since Like A Virgin.
Not bad, the last one was better.
It's an ok album with some great tracks, not a great album. Nice for the summer.
As one who ignored the panning of American Life (which was so incredibly underrated) and appreciates the chances Madonna takes (much of Erotica is also incredibly underrated), I approached this album with enthusiasm and trepidation. First two listens, I wasn't quite sure. After that, total bliss. Are you freakin' kidding me? This is the sweetest album we've had on constant play in our cars. So many albums are reconsidered in hindsight, and I'm sure this will be one that ends up on future critics' lists as a great fusion of the sounds, musicians and producers of a certain time period mixed with an artistic icon who actually is a major part of the creative process. And those same critics will claim that they loved it at the time. Kudos to everyone involved.
I have been a fan of Madonna for her entire career. As a teen in the 80s she was the soundtrack to my life. I think this album is great with one exception. Spanish Lesson. If it is a lesson shouldn't you be telling me the actual meanings of the words instead of kinda what you think they mean.
There are some jams on this album.
Madonna doesn't disappoint she still has the touch despite 25 years in the industry.
It's a grower.
More highlights than dissapointments, and an overall very good pop album. However by the standards Madonna had set with her 2005 'Confessions' album... Hard Candy fails in nearly every creative aspect. Most credit here is due to producer Timbaland.. who keeps forking out hits wherever he sets foot.
Wrost album of the year. Bye bye Madonna...
I have no doubt that 'Hard Candy' is a good album... Some of the songs are impossible to dislike, but other ones are impossibles to hear... It's too warm... And what I think about it?? I think that Madonna can do somethings REALLY better.
It has some really good songs and some really bad ones. It's a lot more uneven than her other records. Also thematically and lyrically it's not unified like her other records. Also I don't think R&B and hip are her style. She sounds much better and at home doing dance or pop/rock. Also, I really miss her ballads.
Blech! I cannot stand Madonna fighting for attention against Pharrell's production. I enjoy both of them, but definitely not together. Hard Candy, in my opinion, is Madonna's single-largest misstep.
At least an album with a thought behind the musical and vocal research. Madonna hasn't been singing in so many different styles for a while...Finally, her extension has become more flexible too. All in all, a very sweet candy! P.S. props to Pharrell!!!!
Madonna is finally back to form, no spirituality or political nonsense. It's been awhile since I heard an album with hardly any fillers and filled with highly produced and well written music that flows very well together, starting off sexy and flamboyant and then ending on a much darker and intellectual note - something very few artists are capable of pulling off. A very enjoyable listen and certainly won't leave my play list for at least a couple of months.
Amazing. Full of funky beats and melodic rythms. Miles awa being the best.
This is a solid album and defintely one of Madonna's better ones. Songs like Give It To Me, Dance 2Nite, and Voices are probably some of Madonna's best songs since the Music album. I noticed that a lot of the critical reaction is mainly against her current choice of mainstream collaborators (Timbaland, P. Wlliams, Timberlake) which is rather unfair, if this was produced by an unheard producer it would be considered nothing short of genius.
Sounds like Britney Spears, any pop star could have made it. I agree, the production has overtaken her own persona. But it's not her worst, American Life will take that prize.
Yes. Metacritic isn't being fair. This site has ignored almost all of Hard Candy's good reviews!
METACRITIC your not including best reviews like the New your times or Los Angeles times there are also good reviews on People and US magazine it will improve the average of the album, you are only adding the bad reviews, don´t know why.
I don't know why she gave up on the techno style of the last two albums. This album seems forced and her voice sounds terible. I am all for change if it is for the better. This is not!
A very solid Madonna album, featuring some of her best songs in recent history including GIVE IT 2 ME, HEARTBEAT, MILES AWAY, INCREDIBLE and DEVIL WON'T RECOGNIZE YOU. Excellent vocal performance as well. Go Madonna!
When compared to Confessions, I can't give it more than an 8/10. I don't understand the negative reviews, because it's really not that bad. There are some classic tracks on here such as Devil, Give It To Me and Miles Away. She was only putting out an album that would attract an American audience that failed to see the wonder of her last, and greatest album.
Awful. Vile artwork. Simple melodies and dire lyrics.
I really tried hard to like this album, but failed. The songs are just so simple, and forgettable. What in God's name does the whole "boxer" costume have to do wtih "Hard Candy"? However, I have to praise Madonna a little bit, because not many of her fellow senior citizens have the energy to do what she does.
There's rhythm, theres plenty of room for dancing. The only reason why I'm not giving it a 10 is because after a while listening to this album you may get depressed - some happy song would have been just fine.
Terrible album. Not just in terms of her own catalogue, but by other artist's catalogues too. This was the first time Madonna was following the trend, instead of setting it. Timbaland's production was fated to date, and it did (within about 6 months). Most of the tracks contain little melody or dance-ability. It somehow sounds very expensive yet cheap and nasty at the same time. The only thing that saves this album from being a total dud, are a few select tracks that have Madonna's true sound/feeling - "Miles Away" & "Give It To Me".
Hard Candy is probably Madonna's first weightless album that embraces fully the influences of urban genres R&B and hip-hop. If sometimes uneven, the dance floor scorchers come non-stop. Lacks in depth but very very fun.
Hard Candy is pleasing to hear, clearly aimed at a younger audience yet using sexual innuendos as a way of attracting her older fans. One of Madonnas traits!
I'm a huge Madonna fan and i loved Confessions, but I'm really dissapointing with this album, the lyrics are generally stupids and She sounds tired, hopefully her next album will be much better.
Nothing special, it just felt like "another Madonna's album". Her hip-hop collaborators clearly can't make that "thing" happen. Tracks like "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You" or "Miles Away" are exceptionals.
this album found madonna in the commercial spotlight, which made her sound boring and re done. While this era gave us give it 2 me and heartbeat as well as devil wouldn;t recognize you, it left some fans yearning for M to drop the "at the moment producers" for the underground ones that had previously made her successful.
Hard Candy is by far the worst Madonna album to date. After Confessions, this is incredibly disappointing. It is a good album, but not a good Madonna album - I expected much more. Nevertheless, it does have it's moments and, if you forget it's Madonna, it's actually a decent album (but I can't help but compare it to her other albums which are much better). If I was to listen to Hard Candy, I'd skip exactly half the album (which is not good at all). The tracks you should listen to are the first three, Beat Goes On, Devil Wouldn't Recognize You and Voices. Don't even bother with the others. If this was an EP with the aforementioned 6 tracks, it would get a perfect rating, but the other 6 songs are horrid in my opinion
Another triumph for Madonna!Hard Candy see's Madonna use r&b which she dabbled with on Bedtime stories only its the 21 Century R&Balbum highlights include:- 4 minutes- give it 2 me- shes not me- Devil wouldnt recognise you- Candy shopits a great album with great success!just another one for Madonna to add to the collection
I love this album. Her voice is sounding amazing! Timbaland and Justin weren't her bests collaborations, but they did a good job with her. "Miles Away" and "Beat Goes On" are the best. And Give It 2 Me is a great song to hear and dance when you're happy!
I just love this album. I know that lot of Madonna fans hate it, and I don't know why. It's really good, especially songs that Madonna wrote with Pharrell (Heartbeat, SNM, Incredible).I can listen to this all the time.
Probably one of the weakest albums in Madonna's repertoire. The two best tracks being the first two singles but overall the effort falls short. I hate when bad albums happen to great artists.
Eu odeio esse álbum, uma sonoridade chata, letras vergonhosas, eu não sei como Madonna teve coragem de gravar essa porcaria. WTF is Incredible? Desperdício de tempo e dinheiro com esse álbum lixoso.
This is probably in my top 5 Madonna albums, so it really confuses me why people don't like it. It's upbeat and fun, start to finish, and there are a lot of great hooks and choruses here that make it very enjoyable. The style is also a nice change of pace from her other stuff, this being a bit more percussion heavy. My personal favorites are 4 Minutes, Incredible, Dance 2Nite, and Devil Wouldn't Recognize You. Even the oft reviled Spanish Lesson is fun, mostly because it's so quirky and bizarre. Overall, I highly recommend this album. It gets lots of plays from me.
I was 14 when i first heard this album. From then i became obsessed with Madonna. I love everything in this album. One of the best albums from 2008...
This is the best album for running. Period. Thanks to this album I've managed to finish my first marathon and Olympic triathlon last year. Strongly recommend for athletes and fitness music lovers!
Šis albums iznāca R&B ēras norieta laikā 2008. gadā, kas, iespējams, varētu būt par iemeslu albuma zemajiem komerciālajiem panākumiem. Saturiski tas sastāv no diva veida dziesmām – pusi producējis Timbaland, tostarp lielāko albuma hitu 4 minutes, duetu ar Džastinu Timberleiku; otru pusi – Farels Viljams. Tieši šis mūziķis/ producents savos 40 gados pagājušo gad piedzīvoja karjeras mezmarizēšanos ar hitiem Get Lucky un Blurred Lines, kura iedīglis, manuprāt, sastopams šajā albumā, t.i., dziesma Give it 2 me, kurā Madonna lustīgā R&B un deju mūzikas savijuma pavadījumā dzied par to, kā visa pasaule ir bezbailīga mūziķa priekšā. Pieņemu, ka šobrīd, laikā, kad arī Timbalands un Džastins Timberleiks, kā arī vieglāka R&B mūzika sāk atgriezties radiostacijās, Hard Candy būtu tieši laikā, jo tajā samijās iepriekšminētais žanrs ar Madonnai raksturīgajām melodiskajām dziesmām un liriku ziņā neatkarīgo skatījumu uz pasauli. Noklausoties visu albumu jāsecina, lai gan 4 minutes bija komerciāli veiksmīgs singls, kurš ticis pārdots 6 miljonos eksemplāru ASV, tajā ir ļoti maz pienesuma no Medžas un tas ‘aprija’ pārējo albumu, kurš ir pilns ar no šī brīža skatu punkta inovatīvām dziesmām. Veiksmīgākās no tām iepriekšminētā Give it 2 me; Spanish Lesson, She’s not me, Devil Would not Recognize You.
A very good album but not a Madonna standard album. The dance beats and the Justin Timberlake flavoured production sounds stunning at times but fails to justify Madonna. Madonna delivers a very powerful message on the song "Beat Goes On". She sings....."Say what you likeDo what you feelYou know exactly who you areThe time is right nowYou've got to decideStand in the back or be the star".The album contains some very precious gems - "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You" and "Voices".
Its good, for both fans and typical listeners. Many funky and catchy beats, but its not great and nowhere near as good as some of madonna's other albums
Bom disco, sonoridade exata das produções de Timbaland e Pharrell porém sem perder a essência de Madonna. Um álbum onde ela ainda conseguia alinhar a criação de hits com qualidade musical.Candy Shop: 74 Minutes: 6Give It 2 Me: 5Heartbeat: 7Miles Away: 9She's Not Me: 8Incredible: 8Beat Goes On: 9Dance2Night: 6Spanish Lessons: 6Devil Wouldn't Recognize You: 8Voices: 7Ring My Bell: 7Total: 7,1
muchos dirian que es su peor trabajo, es algo malo pero no tanto, el album tiene lo suyo
So catchy at the beggining but so dissapointing by the end.Is a good attempt but not enough...
If she had included across the sky this would be an amazing album, but this has amazing beats, the rythms are incredibles, as simple as this, it's a wonderful album.
Overall, Hard Candy sounds a bit too much like Madonna’s trying to catch up with the American R&B princesses. Having said that, she holds her own for the most part, and when her own voice shines through, she reminds us why she’s outlasted so many.
Hard Candy is a serviceable . The album is irritating.Atrocious for an artist of her calibre. So dissapointing
Sem dúvida o pior álbum da Madonna, os singles são muito bons mas no resto o disco se trona datado e com uma sonoridade igual em todas as músicas, para quem gosta dos sons dos anos 200 de Justin Timberlake e Timbaland é um bom álbum, mas para quem não ficou preso no tempo esse é um disco dispensável na discografia da Rainha.
I discovered this album a decade later and I love this record. JT, Tim and Pharrell did their own thing but M somehow managed to put a twist of her pop-oriented instinct with her signature lyricism. This album is pure fun and I love how buoyant this record is. There's this rawness that was lack since her Like A Virgin days and in tracks like Candy Shop and She's Not Me, she sang with so much sass that I didn't hear since Erotica. The frivolous side of her seemed meshed with her serious confessional side better than COADF which I felt didn't match up enough. She and JT should collab more as I felt they connected with each other more as songwriters compare to Nicki Minaj or Quavo. That connection really reflects in this record and I love M pushed Timbaland signature beats further with tracks like Voices where lush orchestra somehow melts with trip-hop beats magnificently. I can relate to this record personally and the downside is that M singing was pushed into more staccato which at times felt vacant.
What a hard task - to be the following release after the globally acclaimed Confessions On a Dance Floor (2005), no, really, what a DOUBLE hard task, she also had to present something new after only 2/3 years of her last reinvention.This is not a bad record at all, people just didn't get it because it's Madonna doing R&B. It's not like she hasn't done it before, it was just at a bad timing. Electropop/EDM was getting back at it's track and she was a little late. But, the whole record itself is very well produced, the highlights are amazing tracks (Devil Wouldn't recognize/Miles Away) and it was the background for the highest grossing tour for a solo act (still holds that record as of 2019!/female). I only wish she hadn't kept "Across the Sky" out of the final cut.
Честно говоря, при первом прослушивании альбом кажется обычным, местами скучным, но на самом деле альбом очень хорош, но многие песни АБСОЛЮТНО проходные.
Smash hits 4 minutes and 4 million copies sold Hard Candy, I am still waiting for the reissue of Vinyl.
Hard Candy, although counting with good producers and songwriters, seems boring to what 4 Minutes, the first single of the album, promised.
it’s fun. has bops.groovy. but not that the best thing ever. rather listen to the tour version Sticky and Sweet
Para um álbum que em 2008 foi acusado de soar clichê e mais do mesmo, Hard Candy envelheceu muito bem. Soa interessante e fresco mesmo depois de 12 anos. Um prato cheio para os fãs e para o público jovem que está conhecendo o trabalho da Madonna agora.
It’s the most underrated albums of Madonna’s Career. A piece of art that shines 12 years later
El album tiene canciones increibles e inolvidables como 4 Minutes o Give it 2 Me, Excelente Producción, Letras Pegajosas, Pero hay algun Problema, El album ha envejecido muy mal, demasiado mal
Okay. Being Madonna, nothing she does is not innovative. Nonetheless, after 3 years of releasing one of her best projects and a pop masterpiece which was Confessions On A Dancefloor, this album fell pretty flat for the standards. Although 4 minutes is an amazing song and Give it 2 me is almost as good, the more you get through the album the more you want to listen to anything else. Less than half of the songs are pretty lackluster, and some songs like Incredible and She's Not Me, are way too long to be that mediocre.
Recycling the same sound over and over throught this album kills it. Listening to whole project doesn't have any sense, hence every song is very similar to another. Listening to songs individually is much better, and they click then. Because of that I would argue that 'Hard Candy' is not only Madonna's worst album I've listened to, but also her attempt to do something like Drake does nowadays. And also a bad attempt to ride Timbaland sound.However, even though that whole album is one-sound mush, there are some highlights. "4 Minutes" shows true Timbaland and Danja glory, while "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You" is still similar to rest of non-singles, it's darker, and more enjoyable. Album closer "Voices" is the darkest song out there, and the most distinctive - it doesn't sound like anything on the album. I also like "Give it 2 Me", "Miles Away", "Heartbeat", "Beat Goes On", and "Dance 2Night".However too much cohesiveness it's not the only flaw here. "She's Not Me" and "Incredible" are stretched out to 6 minutes...why? Cut those unnecessery outros! "She's Not Me" is sucha sassy song, but it's dragged down with its leangth...
Sometimes, You have to be in the mood to dance to listen to this album entirely. Songs like MIles Away, Give It 2 Me, and Spanish Lesson are all excellent songs to dance to.
She can sometimes wallow in retro pop a bit too much but this eclectic mix really works and santogold has also seemed to grasp good pop ideals of catchy riffs and awesome instrumentation. She somehow manages to be part of and subvert the indie scene at the moment and its something everyone can listen too and enjoy if only because i love squealing the intro to creator!
Absolutely great album - probably the most fresh 2008's stuff...
What impresses about her songs are the depth, the hooks are intantly gratifying, instantly likeable, but somehow manage to get more and more profound upon each listen. You're mesmerized, disoriented, taunted even, but through the twists and turns her voice cuts through and achors you down. This kind of all consuming music is hard to come by, I'm compelled to dance, to spin, to fly, to dig deep.... it doesn't get much better folks.
Thanks for Metacritic or else I wouldn't have discovered Santogold. This album is what the U.S. needed. Arguably, the only decent music that comes from the Hip-hop/R&B/Rap genres (there are few outside of this such as LCD Soundsystem), and there hasn't been an amazing new artist in the U.S. since Lupe Fiasco (in my opinion, again). Truthfully, I can't even place Santogold in one specific genre, which is the best thing about her. She draws comparison to M.I.A with her working with known M.I.A. producers, Diplo and Switch but I think she stands her ground. Definitely check out L.E.S. Artistes, You'll Find A Wat, Starstruck, Unstoppable and I'm A Lady.
I think it's a great, versatile album. There is not a single track on it you'd want to skip when listening.
Possibly my favorite album of the 2000's. She takes all the lessons learned from pop music of the late 70's through today and melds them into a genius sound; disco beats under punk bass with reggae backing vocals and a pop hook, with occasional hip-hop rapping to drive home points. Really, really excellent.
A fantastic debut, mashing various styles and sounds, from electro, punk, rock and pop with a wider world influence, flavours of M.I.A., Bjork and even Gwen Stefani. Ultimately a strong and determined voice, with a a sense of passion and determination. A fresh classic album to define the summer of 08, I cant wait to see her live.
It's the perfect blend of pop, indie, rock, dance, alt and electronic music. Santogold really is in a genre by itself.
From start to finish this is a really listenable and most excellent album. Very eclectic mix of styles; indie, new wave, dance, dub reggae, etc... One song will sound like The Pretenders, another like M.I.A, then another like No Doubt, then another like Tegan and Sara and then 4 others like nothing I've ever heard before. Despite the fact that I'm a dude, I can't stop listening to "I'm a Lady". What a freakin' song!
This album is amazing and then it gets better with every listen. Song by song it is not hard to make comparisons - one song is like one of the best MIA songs, another like one of the best YYYs songs. They all hang together and in fact when you listen as a group and get a feel for the big idea here none of the comparisons make any sense. This album is for real. If I have heard a better album this year I must have forgot about it when I started listening to this.
While it resembles M.I.A it enters territory not covered by the latter and does so effectively. i.e It kicks some serious ass and will be pumping in my ride for at least the next week
Weird but wonderful with at least three gems on there that are 'first time lovers'.
In my opinion, this is the best album of 2008 I have listened to, so far. It's truly amazing. Purchase this album, if you're interested.
Is it me or does this feel like a recycled version of bloc party's silent alarm with r'n'b twangs added to make it a bit different. it's still pretty good but only as an IT album. Don't expect fireworks. more like a 6.5.
This isn't usually my sort of music so I was pleasantly surprised by this as it is one of my favourite albums of the year now.
Santigold did a perfect job on this album, combining perfectly and mergers distant sounds amazing, fun melodies and a very particular depth in her voice and lyrics, without a doubt one of the best alternative albums of the decade and one of the best voices of the moment, Creator and LES Artistes are masterpieces! i really enjoy her music!
Santigoldâ
This thing moves from start to finish. A few moments to breathe here or there, but otherwise it makes pop/dance non-stop pop/dance music seem easy. Great for running, working out and driving.
Absolutely fantastic album all 'round. One of the best of 2008. Weird that even the reviews that gave it low scores seem to praise it. I don't know why this site allows shit reviewers that no one cares about to drag down the overall score of a fantastic album such as this.
Quite honestly, this album hasn't left my CD player since it came out. it's simply stellar. it'll be hard to top this one for album of the year on my 2008 list. also saw cut copy live a few weeks ago and it was one of the most outrageous, dance-tastic shows i've ever seen!
Hey, this band is so hip-hypnotic!!! I don't usually like what sounds here to be like dance music but these guys made a really really good album... Now .... why in the world did they name their band "Cut Copy." I mean, something like "Evolution" would have been more dramatic for them and their groovey sound!
Might grow on me, but so far has not lived up to the standard of the prereleased singles. Having said that it should get 8 points alone for Hearts on Fire being one of the tracks
The perfect spring /summer day to evening soundtrack. Seemless from beginning to end, and as dynamic as it is varied without being too schizophrenic, it's hands down the best release so far in 2008.
A musical gem of epic proportions. A beautiful, yet catchy album with some incredible songs. Probably, the best album of 08.
Brilliant, gorgeous, original and absolutely catchy as hell! All these things probably make this the best of 2008.
One of the best dance records this year, thanks to DFA man Tim Goldsworthy for producing it.
This is one of the most energetic releases that has ever graced my hammer, anvil, and stirrup. After this album, I do believe in magic.
This album has a few real standout songs, but the rest is really nothing special.
Simply brilliant. It's a seamless flow of excellent music.
Refreshing, unchallenging, perfect for the positivity, fun and listenability that it's added to my music collection. It's simple, engaging, enjoyable and hasn't worn off on me after 15 listens. Perfect.
Easily, album of the year.
So rare to find an album that is just pure catchy joy to listen to. Every song has hooks and is different enough to be interesting. Daft Punk crossed with New Order...outstanding record of the year so far by a mile.
The perfect blend of disco, 80's dance music, and today's electronics, with some Joy Division guitars to make it even cooler.
This album is like delicious New Order that doesn't suck. I can't stop listening to it. I bought their debut CD and its just as amazing!
Its SO close to being a flawless album I had to give it a 10. Its a 9.7/9.8, but I had to round up. This CD is amazing.
About the only gripe I'd have is that the link tracks don't do much for me if they pop up in 'shuffle' mode. That's not Cut Copy's fault. They've made an old-fashioned elpee, and a great one at that. Sure it's derivative, but the song construction is so sharp and the production so deliciously thick it hardly matters. It's been on my playlist for two months and looks to rule the summer for two or three more. The record of the year at the midway point.
My favorite disc of last year, a must own for those who look back fondly on music from the 80's.
The coolest and freshest album I've heard in ages. Now, this is real music.
Truly a revelation. It's a joy to listen to from start to finish. This is destined to be a classic.
Is it just me or was this one of, possibly THE BEST release of 2008?
Brilliant collection of electronic, dance songs. Probably, the best album of 08.
Okay, I've only been listening to this band since the beginning of 2008; however, even though at first I would only occasionally listen, they have slowly crept up the rungs of my addiction ladder. One question that is totally perturbing me with all the reviews: Why don't I read more about comparisons with New Order? This band has taken a similar aesthetic and rocketed it to a whole new level. To be sure, I am a fan of every genre of music and even do my own acoustic/countrified versions of New Order songs when playing solo gigs. This band is definitely on my list of recommended listens for perspective on the sounds of this decade.
This album is like delicious suck that doesn't new order. I can stop listening to it any moment I choose. I bought their debut CD and its just as non-amazing as this crude.
Beautifully and sympathetically produced, this is a cohesive set of pop songs dressed up as electro/dance. Unashamedly romantic lyrics cut through painterly washes of synth, summery acoustic strumming, and the occasional rave-up sound effect. The presence of Tim Goldsworthy behind the boards cannot be underestimated - what a remarkable transformation from their debut!
Hugely diverse record. There's rock, pop and dance. It's upbeat, it's glory filled, there's angst, there's melancholy. It's fast, it's slow and, the majority of the time, it all comes together incredibly well.
I love this album, it's fun, nostalgic and groovy all at the same time. This is a very clear sound Cut Copy developed since their debut. One of the great examples of the disco-punk/no wave sound.
It's an average pop album. I expected something much better from Kylie. There are several amazing tracks (2 Hearts, Like a Drug, In My Arms, Speakerphone, Wow), but most other tracks are not so good.
The album is a definite comeback. Most of the songs have single potential and Kylie proved once again that she can produce real pop music!
I think this cd is great! I agree that there isn't a real "standout" track, however, it is of generally higher quality than her last two albums. I think her longevity and ability to rise above both cancer and "Britneyesque" behavior show true talent and professionalism.
Amazing, reminds me Fever, true pop/dance music!
There are tracks here that are pure pop goodness, but not many.
Pop perfection! Kylie stays true to her pop roots and delivers another great album!
There is something here for everyone. Only 3 tracks fail to grab me, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't play to someone else's tastes.
Absolutely outstanding album. Every song is bursting with individuality! such a refreshing collection of tracks. furthermore, just what expectations do people have of Kylie? She has excelled herself through and through with this record, as have her production team. Thumbs up! What a delight to listen to at any time of the day! Magnetic Electric should be released without a doubt!
This new cd, "X", puts Kylie back on the pop map!!! it blows Britney outta the water, cuz Kylie can actually sing!!! from the 1st track on down it is a journey, it's amazing!! like a drug, all i see, the one, stars, and the hidden track rippin up the dancebfloor are just a few of the fab tracks!! take a listen you will love this cd!!!
AMAZING!!! awesome 80's dirty pop and electronic songs... I found alot of bonus tracks floating around the net, would of liked those to be on the release!
Begs, borrows, and steals from the leaders in the dance/pop field! Minogue remains a safe, predictable follower! Could she please lose the fake Brit accent? It is so grating!
One of the best and classy pop albums this year! Kylie sure knows how to put a album together, She simply never disappoints her fans! For get HARD CANDY, For real pop experience, get this album instead!
Kylie is back and better than ever.
Absolutely fantastic! Sweet peace of Wow & No More Rain to the jaw-dropping work of Speakerphone! 10 through and through.
This Album is Far better then most crap pop artists put out these days. All the Tracks here are well produced and classy! Kylie does not disappointed her long time fans at all, The Streak continues!
I may be a bit biased since I've been a fan of Kylie for most of her career, but I don't know what all of these critics are talking about. Maybe many of them expected some great cancer battle revelation or a some kind of dance pop-cum-deep confession album, but since when was dance pop not supposed to be fun or deeply confessional? Yeah, this record is at times overproduced (Nu-di-ty) and maybe not innovative (Stars), but take many of these songs alone and you've got a fine collection of pop gems: 2 Hearts may not have been the best choice for a first single, but alone it's a fine record; Like a Drug is electro heaven, All I See is perhaps, one of the finest Kylie R&B moments ever, and The One is dance pop perfection! Love her or hate her, Kylie has got charisma and natural charm that few pop stars out there possess. Her natural ability to attract audiences young and old, in spite of lack of great vocal ability and sometimes annoying and nasal cooing, are what still makes her one of the best pop stars ever!!!
A grower, not a shower. A little disappointing but listen to it a few times and it will grow on you.
A great comeback! Fresh, catchy songs from beginning to ending! Combines different styles of music for a big success! Totally recommended!
Some killer tracks but unfortunately a lot of filler. More of a compilation than an album. A pity - she has played the game much better on the last two albums.
Its really cool.... some songs are so nice!! 2 hearts and all I see.... just cant get them out of my head!!
Been a fan fo since her original 80's debut, She always sets high standards for herself and she again has given her best. I love this CD.
It's fine. Just fine. "Speakerphone," "Like a Drug" and "2 Hearts" really do stand-out. Then there's "Stars," "Cosmic" and the nonsensical what's-it-doing-here "Nu-Di-Ty." "Wow" is wonderful!
Although it is not as cohesive as Madonna's Confessions on a Dancefloor Album, it is certainly more heartfelt. "No More Rain" and "Cosmic" highlight the singer's struggles with breast cancer and triumphant return to the stage, while "The One", "Speakerphone", "Like a Drug" and "In My Arms" are as good as dance-pop gets. The hidden track obtained by putting the CD into a computer is another piece of Dance-Pop gold. An Absolute MUST for any fan of fantastic pop.
This album fulfilled every hope I had about it. Kylie's back and better than ever. Some tracks such as In My Arms, 2 Herats and Sensitized are both well produced and creative and the whole album has a amazing 80's air to it.
I've got to say, Miss Minogue has made some pretty good music back her years, however, her 2008 album "X" has not been a smash, although charting globally and the hit single "2 Hearts", it isn't what we call a "Disco, House, Electropop" album. It is good, but lacks the music we really like.
For a return to the music industry after an unexpected hiatus, X is a decent effort. This album hold quite a lot of sentimental value, but this should not delude from the fact that this album does show a lot of disjointed pot holes. Different writers and different producers have all had their hands in this: Kish Mauve, Xenomania, Calvin Harris, Steve Anderson and so forth and it definitely shows as this album takes on multiple identities, rather than one 'album' entity. I think every track on here is worthy to be on a Kylie album, just not together. Personal favourites are: Like A Drug, Speakerphone and Sensitized.
A stunning record. It confirms why Kylie remains one of music's most iconic electro-pop artists. The producers may be very much in charge here, but her personality and timeless sex appeal still shine through. It's absolutely one of the 00's most important dance records.
I LOVE this album! "WOW", "In My Arms" and "Speakerphone" are phenomenal, strong and my personal favourite songs from this album. Album as a whole is energetic disco-pop.
An utterly stunning comeback. Track by track this album oozes stylish sex appeal. Kylie prooves with this album that unlike Madonna (and all those other frustrating comparisons) she moves with the times with her own sound, not jumping from genre to genre to proove how cool she is. Electro pop has never felt so fresh and classic all at the same time, play it loud, play it quietly it stays with you all day, and to myself, it will stay for years to come. There might be the odd dull moment or moment that feels a little forced, but hey, what artist doesn't nower days ? A truely outstanding album that shouldn't be forgotten as one of the ultimate comeback albums.
Kylie's most electric album to date. Fun, stylish and sometimes touching music from the ultimate 'Princess of Pop'. She gave her adoring fans exactly what they wanted, and that's what matters most.
Probably one of the most underestimated albums Kylie has ever released. This album offers different genres of dance in a grand mixture. Download: The One, 2 Hearts, Speakerphone
A great album with innovative character, being released after a difficult phase of the singer. Brought a electropop sound with the album "Blackout" Britney Spears that was not common in the music industry.
Kylie tries to reinvent herself after a hiatus and the overall composition is not what she is good at.
X sure does deserve an X (10) because this album is so unique and nothing like Kylie has ever done before. She incorporates jazz with techno pop and it just works. However I still think Like a Drug should have been a single instead of In My Arms.
This album was underrated by the pompous music press for the most part. It's a cool and quirky records and I'm still playing a bunch of these tracks, most particularly Like A Drug which IMO is one of her best ever tracks. Is it perfect? No. Is it quality pop? Absolutely. The fact that it is all over the map musically is why it works so well. No-one wants a pop record where every track has been over produced to sound like one heavily crafted vibe. Chaos in pop is a good thing. I wish more reviewers would stop pandering to their readership and dispense with the cliche soundbites. Kylie's released a pretty out there set of songs with a cool vibe for people who don't need to check in with their friends before offering an opinion about whether they feel like spending time to get to know a new record as we used to in the days of vinyl.
In her tenth studio album, the Australian surprises her listeners with a cohesive album, strong+original sound, and her personality by doing more pop precision in her career. Without a doubt, X is one of the albums that make up the trinity of his best albums.
This album feels like it's trying a bit of everything, in a bad way. This is her first album since she was diagnosed with cancer, some people expect a personal/stripped down album, but it ended up being a dance-pop album, but also dubstep... and R&B... and glam rock. You see, these genres don't go really well together. But if she wanted to make an album to forget about those hard times and have fun, I would've put the demos on it, they are better than some of the tracks that made the cut and would've made X a fun pop record.Now this doesn't mean the record doesn't have some bangers, the strong points of this album are Like A Drug, In My Arms, Speakerphone (best song on the album), The One and Wow. After that, it's forgettable, 2 Hearts is her worst choice as a lead single in years, Nu-Di-Ty is a quirky tune that could be played at rave parties, Sensitized doesn't really stand out and it's quite forgettable.This could've perfectly been a perfect pop album if it included demos like Cherry Bomb, Sexual Gold, Magnetic Electric, In The Mood For Love, etc.Overall, a mess of an album, with a bunch of bangers and a bunch of filler.
Easily one of the better works from this prestigious duo. "Alive 2007" contains a flawless execution of house and memorable charm which was already present in the original songs. This is the perfect daily dose for you rave and techno/house lovers out there.
I'm not even a fan of house music but this album is a major exception.
Dear Jesus, Thank you for this.
Insane! absolutely best Daft CD I own.
flawless live album, everything that is good about daft punk rolled into an incredible hour+. great listening experience you wont soon forget. The track lead-ins are fantastic, and the French duo manages to make material from their alright album 'human after all' seem fresh and energetic.
Get the DVD, the visual production is amazing, The best live music show I ever seen, a mindblowing visual experience. About the music, its a great selection of Daft Punk work.
I found this soo boring to try to listen to.
An excellent mix of their best material through the years. A great new spin on old classics.
One of the very great Live albums of our times, this album encapsulates the energy and versatility of electronica and house that Daft Punk so vehemently pioneered in the 90's and 00's. If you listen to this and don't wish you were there, sweaty, battered yet oh so happy, then maybe you should think about retiring from the DJ scene.
One of the best live albums ever; it's a very good Daft Punk album. If you're a Daft Punk fan, it's a must have. Listening to it really makes you feel like you were at the concert.
Incredible! If you like to dance... then this cd is for all y'all!
Truly, a refreshing way to release a greatest hits of sorts. its familiar while still being new.
Simply Amazing. No words can describe how perfect this album is. Just go out buy it and experience it for yourself. I missed their 2007 tour but I won't make that mistake again if they plan to do Alive 2017.
To anyone that understands what a DJ set is there will be no mistake of considering this album brilliant. The live show is being considered by many the best concert ever. I was lucky enough to be at their LA concert and from a jaded concert-goer perspective I was blown away by the experience. I am just glad that this album exist to let me feel with every listen simply ALIVE.
I have found it very hard to dissipate my need, yes, NEED to listen to this cd on a daily basis. Daft Punk seamlessly intertwine all of their best and worst songs off of their last 3 albums, creating a unique and highly addictive record. I'm just in a vegetative state of shock and awe at how they were able to turn skippable Human After All tracks (i.e. Steam Machine, Television Rules the Nation, etc.) into sheer spun gold. They seem to have set a new bar for themselves musically, lets just hope their next LP can surpass it.
It appears I missed the party of the year, a welcome return to form. How did they get those bloody awful Human After All tracks to suddenly sound so good?
I never hand out 10s. But, this album is an exception simply because of the amazing energy and pure vivid sound that is emitted, in one of the best live albums of all time. I don't particularly dig live albums however. To me, most are not balanced in crispness and energy along with enthusiasm from the spectators. This album is a perfect portrayal of daft punk's house party atmosphere, and it actually sounds damn good with few tracks that drawl out. Highly recommended for fans and still a fun album for first-timers.
This is the best release bar none by Daft Punk. Complete with new material and an encore, nothing is more exciting and fresh than the Alive 2007 set. The electronic duo continue to set a new standard for electronic music.
This cd will make you wish you went and saw Daft Punk at one of their Alive! shows. But if, like me you went and spent the entire time dancing sweating and getting high of energy then this cd will take you right back there.
Scintillating, stunning, smoldering. The "critics" gave Discovery a "73" on this site. Let that sink in for a moment. Discovery. Rated lower. Than the latest "shaggy" record. Okay, now that we have thoroughly discredited anyone "credentialed" in true Dadaist fashion, let's just consider the source and acknowledge that this group is amazing and this album belongs with the best in their oeuvre.
I'm really not a big fan of live albums, but this one is damn good. A must-own for Daft Punk fans.
With the exception of too much "Touch It/Technologic" towards the beginning, this is one of the more interesting live albums I've heard. It makes tracks from Human After All sound 10 times better. The bonus CD encore mashup might be worth it on its own. It's a different style entirely than Alive 1997, but it's hard to say which is actually better. Daft fans will undeniably love this.
The best show in the world, the best live cd in the world.
Amazing. I can't believe they realized such a perfect mix of all their most fantastic songs, and all seems perfectly natural and spontaneous. Just listen to "Da Funk/ Daftendirekt" mix to understand. Greatest album made by them of course. Over and over better.
Alive 2007 can be best described as a remastering and a re-invigoration of Daft Punk's earlier works. This doesn't make it bad however. This live project remixes the weak points from Human After All with Daft Punk's earlier works seamlessly.The result is an amazing performance that ranks as one of the most exciting I have ever heard.This performance truly is a treat to listen to, I highly recommend it.
Oh Yeah! It was too long since their 1997 daftendirktour, but they've been alive around the world one more time! What a dicovery this album was to me, it just washed my brain. My teachers tell me the most fresh musique is rock n roll, but the rock from these robots is harder, better, faster and stronger than any other artist!
Obviously anyone that disagrees with Daft Punk hasn't lived long or should
This really makes me wish I could hear them live. It is a incredible experience to feel the great live rhythm of their songs. It impresses me how Daft Punk can make such a work. Flawless.
This album remains my most played album ever, with over 3000 plays. Each and every track clearly shows the amount of precision, effort, and confidence put in by Daft Punk and the result is surreal.
I haven't scored many albums a 10 out of 10 yet until now. It's one of the most essential music collections in electronic dance music (EDM if you will) and one of the most visually stunning, conceptually inspiring and innovative live events in music altogether. It'd be equivalent to committing a sin to not recognize Alive 2007 as a masterpiece. It's biggest achievement and treasure -- aside from actually making their 2005 "dud" Human After All feel at home in our hearts after all -- has to be the remixes of "Around the World / Harder Better Faster Stronger", which has alone inspired the careers of electronic musicians such as deadmau5 (not solely, but a prime majority of it). Although not technically "perfect" by any means, all music has minor flaws -- so do humans and even robots. Perfect scores should be awarded to dedicated pieces of music, concerts, or in this case, altogether, and Alive 2007 is just that. It's not an exaggeration when calling it essential to EDM.
A perfectly executed mash-up of all of the best songs we know and love from the most iconic electronic duo, Daft Punk. This is probably the best live album ever.
One of the most impressive live shows I've ever heard. Sonically, it really sounds like it could have been recorded in-studio with the crowd added in post-production. And that's absolutely incredible.
The best live dance albums that I have ever listened to. I think the biggest achievement of this album is the revival of some of the headache-inducing tracks on Human After All.
Daft Punk is a duo of two French electronic musicians who pioneered the house and electronica genres in the 90s and early 2000s. Their originality and boldness is what drove them to success with a couple of their earliest albums, Homework and Discovery. The success of these albums fueled the creation of their reiteration album in 2007.Their album, Alive 2007, is an impeccable and nostalgic rendition of a collection of live assembled mash-ups of their best songs that we have all come to know and love. This album demonstrates Daft Punk's capability to flawlessly blend their earlier classics into 13 independent tracks. The build up to their previous hit, “Technologic”, used in the 2nd track in the album, “Touch it/Technologic”, perfectly sells the nostalgic feel into the heart of the listeners. The infusion of their hits, “Around the World” and “Harder Better Faster Stronger”, started with the blood pumping beat from “Around the World” and excellently transitioned into their tune, “Harder Better Faster Stronger”, while maintaining a consistent beat. In conclusion, Daft Punk's album, Alive 2007 is a wonder full combination of classic Daft Punk's classics along with their ability to mix songs live, on the spot.
Excellent mix of their old work, and probably one of the best live albums out there. And the visuals make it so much better. Let's hope Daft Punk does another live in 2017, but I guess they have to make another album before that.
Damn. This is pure dope music. Only a single second of listening is enough to prove that DP is one of the greatest things in the music history. Damn, man!
Really really good live CD . They really brought it !. Daft punk are amazing on this. one of the better works from this prestigious duo. "Alive 2007" contains a flawless execution of house and memorable charm which was already present in the original songs. This is the perfect daily dose for you rave and techno/house lovers out there.
one of the best live albums ever released in my opinion, timeless from Daft Punk
One of the best and most innovative albums of all time. With hit songs like Gimme More and Piece Of Me, Ms. Spears proves that even at her lowest, she can still end up making some of the most exhilarating club bangerz.
One of the best albums of 2007. I've never much cared for Britney Spears and her "Music" but this album has proven me wrong. Even if she didn't write most of the tracks (A smart business woman knows when to start and better yet stop). This killer dance album floored me. It will definitely be remembered years from now, for having some of the best dance tracks of the last decade.
Great album. Britney is back. Gimme More is hot. Piece of me the video is awesome!
Surprising! I'm really amazed because this album is very electronic-pop and I'm loving it! I also love the personal lyrics althoguh she did not penned them nevertheless this is a bold move for more!
I had to give a 10 'cause since I got the album I can't stop listening to it, I know her life's been a trouble and that she's going through a lot of things related to her kids, the way she drinks and if she's on drugs.. but the album is really good...is electropop mixed with r&b and brit did a great job, that's the reason why she sold a lot albums around the world. She is one the best sellers ever! at least in the USA. I just hope that everything is gonna be better and that she will realize that the night life and the drugs are not the best! I just hope that one day she will return to music and will do it great as she's done it before! that's why we love you Brit! get well soon!
I thought it really expressed how she felt. Piece of me and Why should I be sad are awesome.
Best Britney Album ever!!!
Absolutely her best. Hands down the years biggest surprise.
You could stick on this album at a party and dance all the way through. It is just full of songs you wanna shake to!
Despite it all.. Britney delivers one of the most greatest dance albums in history!... This will set the clubs on firee!
Don't know what those losers who gave her a low score are listening to, this album rocks! You go girl
Her bestllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllm
its Blackout !! the Best album of 2007 And Britney Best Work to Date no one can come close to this album it was Perfect and i still play this album to this day such a classic album 100100.
Changed pop music with its drop.Proved she is everything that haters didn't want her to be.
The best album in the history of Britney Spears, all the songs are very good.
Very cohisive body of work, my most favorite Britney album! I really that dark aura of this album.
bible of pop ok? who voted lower than 10 didn’t listen to the album
Best album! É uma pena que nessa época a imprensa estava mais divulgado sua vida pessoal e suas tensões ao invés desse trabalho excepcional
This album is so good, Every track is fun and energetic to listen to. My personal favorites are Why Should I Be Sad, Radar, and Get Back, plus many MANY more
Blackout is not only one of the best albums of 2007, but also it is probably Britney's best album. All the songs are amazing, there is not a filler song.
Very strong album from Britney once again. Some say her best album to date, I wouldn't say that, but it's certainly up there! Good.
The best her album ever!!
A famous magazine considers this the fourth best album of the decade 2000-2009. It was recorded in & out of the rehab and you can actually hear that Britney wasn't in the best conditions to record, but she still made the best comeback & amazing dance tracks. "Freakshow" features elements of dubstep, too.
Only time would be able to tell how much this would become the decade-to-come's most influential album. Considering what Britney did before and what she has done after this, Blackout certainly puts itself apart from her other productions, for only one reason: its darkness. Different from the easy-going, glowing "Circus", Blackout has deeper tracks with melodies that are catchy and yet continue to have quality. Certainly influenced by a dark/struggle period in her life, Britney was able to create (since she is the executive producer of it) a cohesive and creative album. "Gimme More", "Freakshow", "Piece of Me" and "Heaven on Earth" are amazing. Incredible work.
Ok I'm looking at Britney's past albums to see how people reviewed them and I'm really confused. People are giving Femme Fatale great reviews, but Blackout has almost 50 negative reviews? That's just not right. I'll keep this short. Blackout forever changed the playing field for pop music. I can play it from start to finish without skipping a single song. This is the Britney that I love. Ahead of its time, but it's a uniquely Britney album. It's Britney, ****
i think this is her best job, in her worst moment, gimme more (single) is powerful and had the "it's britney B***h" that become in a unforgetting line
Britney's comeback album definitely was great but lacked some of what her previous albums had. On "In The Zone" Britney did a song with Madonna and it was the best. Black out is good Standout tracks: "Gimme More" "Why Should I Be Sad" and "Piece of Me"
On paper, a Britney Spears album without the help of writer Max Martin is a recipe for disaster. Yet despite the absence of the Swede, and the fact that Britney was fat, barmy and bald during the lead up to this record, Blackout does not suck. In fact, to date it's the only Spears album worth listening to in its entirety. Many of the tracks have the tendency to sneak up and surprise; she sounds sexy on "Ooh Ooh Baby" without being gross, cool on "Gimme More" without trying too hard, and pissed off on "Piece of Me" without caring a whole lot. Somewhat of a minor miracle!
First, I found it irritating, forgettable, and boring. Different from her previous work. As I listen to it again, I realized that it is entertaining and danceable. Futuristic at its best and shows that Britney will always hire the best. So, the album is Britney's best for me.
Very Solid Good Album!The Best Songs In My Opinion Are:Gimme More, Piece Of Me, Break The Ice, Freakshow, And Oooh Oooh Baby!My Favorite Song Is Get Naked (I Got A Plan)!
I could list why every song on this album is just pure perfection, but it would take too long. "Blackout" is widely regarded as the most influential pop album in recent times, and rightfully so. Absolute perfection.
Spearsâ
So much about Britney's actual "blackout". This version of her public life is splendid enough to make me hug it for the rest of my musically-inclined life. Its her best album since her debut and deserves more credit. As she sang in "Why Should I Be Sad?", "it's time for me to move along/it's time for me to get along". Thats the good news of promise and improvement and while she's at it, there's always Blackout to celebrate a high point in her career.
Even if it's hardly Britney's effort, Blackout is a surprising comeback packed with cleverly produced, club-ready dance tracks that are heavily influenced by the electropop and synthpop genres ("Freakshow" has a striking dubstep influence) and about as catchy as the flu in December.
A somethat surprising album that delivers more than you might actually expected, with loud, sexy, electronica beats as well as some Timbaland style corkers thrown into the mix you can't help but like this album for what it is, pop music. But that's all this album is, it offers little else, nothing that pushes the boat out, nothing overly memorable and sadly the only things that have been pushed to their limits is auto tuning and backing vocalists (Robyn for example), which i'm aware is used with most artists, but at some point a limit should be reached.
This album is the best one by Britney. It signs her return to the music world. The album contains really good dance tracks like Get Naked (I Got a Plan), Piece Of Me and Gimme More. This album has got Britney's touch. This album launched the music in a new planet: the Electro Music.
"Blackout" has re-defined the pop music. Since its release, the culture hasn't been the same. One of the best albums released by Britney Spears. Be sure to check "Heaven on Earth" and "Freakshow" on this album.
This is pop music at its best. Britney went through hard times before and during the recording of this album, but the outcome is nothing less than spectacular. Definitely one of the best albums of the 00s.
Not the best album of Britney Spears had the ability to earn top marks in both the critics and admirers of the critique of pseudo-singer (not the fans, for their opinion should not be taken into account). From there we see the level of artist. No more comments.
Without a doubt her best cd released as of 2012. An it is one the top cd's released in 07. The production is just amazing. On pretty much every track Britney sounds so invested and/or engaged. A great thing to hear, excluding In The Zone, Britney had a tendency to sound like she wasn't really connecting with songs off previous albums. On this album though she sounds like she is having fun and enjoying her time in the recording studio. The album would have sold millions had it been properly promoted and had Britney been in better health. Because at the end of the day it really is that amazing.
Simply, one of the best pop albums of the millennium. Every song on that album is a masterpiece!"It's Britney **** is enough to make the album the most memorable one in history.
Britney's Best Album (Up To 2007)Amazing Tracks And Vocals!Love Every Song..90% A-
best Britney album so far, followed by Femme Fatale and then Circus. Blackout is so sick, deep, new, I love it. congratulations to producers! Still waiting for something like this again from Britney
Probably the best album that Britney Spears will ever produce. It's the only of her records that lacks a bit of the shallow and empty touch that In The Zone exceeded and Femme Fatale sums up in voice effects and over-production.
the world's biggest pop star has released one of her best records. out passing her In The Zone era, Blackout takes you into a world of fame, money, sex and glamour as Britney sings hits like Gimme More featuring Danja and lovey dovey ones like Ooh Ooh Baby alongside the amazing Piece Of Me and Toy Soldier
Britney at her best.I love this album. Not a single track in Blackout disappoints me. She got there first before everyone else jumped on the electro-dance wagon in 2011. Futuristic, sexy, under-rated.My album of 2007.
Her Best Album Up To 2007!
Un album inteligente y sexy que ha logrado ser la inspiración para muchos artistas, es una obra maestra en donde Britney se escucha relajada y donde se le puede escuchar divertida en cada track
This is pretty fantastic for a Britney Spears record. Through her then personal struggles she managed to put out an original and classic dance album in which any of the tracks could be a hit single. Download: Every track except "Hot as Ice", "Why Should I Be Sad" and "Get Back" (and definitely not "Everybody" found on the deluxe edition).
best album ever best album ever best album ever best album ever best album ever best album ever best album ever best album ever best album ever best album ever best album ever best album ever
Baby One More Time is her best album, just because is her debut album but this is definitely her most personal album, Britney Jean is just a waste of time... This is a truly comeback.
Funny thing is that Britney recorded her (by far) best album while she was at her worst. Blackout is a really nice album and has made history in many cultures. It has those beats all over, but they're by no means generic and still really dance-able today. You hit the right spot, Ms. spears!
After a three year hiatus amid a mental breakdown, Britney Spears proved that she was still reigning pop royalty. Each track has its own unique sound, propelled by inferior production. By far her most adventurous work to date!
The 2007 album, Best album of Spears.The amazing and cool album, Gimme More, Hot As Ice and Piece Of Me are best songs of princess of pop!Danja is so amazing, Pharell is so cool and Timbaland is so fantastic...Britney is the only princess of pop
Um grande álbum. Não é à toa que ele é considerado o melhor da carreira de Britney Spears e uma Bíblia do Pop. Muito bem produzido e com músicas conceituais, ele, se fosse lançado hoje, seria atual. Muito bom. :)
This Is a Perfect album. Yes the Gimme More is super and Piece Of Me a big hit, Radar & Break The Ice this amazing. This Perfect. Britney 4 big hit in 1 album.
Blackout, considerado o melhor álbum de Britney pela maioria dos fãs, é sim, o melhor álbum dela, e talvez um dos melhores álbuns pop da década de 2000. É um CD que revolucionou a música pop, principalmente a faixa "Freakshow", que "inventou" o dubstep, e se ele não existisse, a música pop não seria como ela é hoje. Todas as faixas são boas, não tem como escolher uma melhor.
Blackout is the pop electronic album of the decade. Its a masterpeice and its a real shame that people can't enjoy it because of the credibility that Britney seems to have nowadays.
I never liked her but this album is her best by far. Catchy chorus and beat. Of course after you have to consider she probably didn't write a single word or contribute in any way to this album but after all it's Britney Spears.
His worst album for sure, processed voice, songs stressful, sickening beats, the only good song of this album may be "Break the Ice". There's a lot of poor songs in this record.
"Blackout" is, without a doubt, Britney's best album. It was released during the roughest time of her live, and when her image was very damaged because of her erratic behaviour (in fact, "Blackout" is the only Britney album that hasn't reached the number 1 spot on the Billboard 200 list). However that shouldn't have affected anyone's vision of the album, and "Blackout" is the most cohesive and meaningful album that she has ever done and, judging by her later efforts, that she will ever do. She didn't do any writing for the album (and she has never been a very productive writer), but the songs really fit her story, so she must have some good choosing skills, or very good writers working for her. The whole album is a statement, and a very effective one. It opens with "Gimme More" and the iconic "It's Britney, **** and is followed by "Piece of Me", one of her best songs ever. It is really sad that her situation was so out of control that she couldn't properly promote or perform these songs, because most of them were extremely mainstream and hits waiting to happen, and not every album has that and maintains it's quality. It is ironic how Britney could deliver her best album in her worst moment, making it to be her most ignored record. Some may say that it's overrated. I don't think it is, at all. I think she couldn't give it the attention it deserved. Highlights: Get Naked (I Got a Plan), Piece of Me, Radar, Hot as Ice
This album is grossly overrated. It sounds like everything Timbaland and co. were doing around the same time, only much, much worse. Generic beats, shallow lyrics, poor vocals... this is one you'll want to pass on.
This album will sway neither the faithful nor the unbelievers from their positions along the borders of her stalled momentum.
Her second best album, Heaven On Earth is epic!
This is horrible. I can't listen to this. I don't want to dance to this. I won't.
Well, it could be worse.
Consistently a good album but how could one say this merits a 10?? or even a 9, 8, 7?? I laugh at those who hail this as her best cd ever! None of her albums are worthy of critical acclaim nor of contimplation of merit. Why do we even care to vote or review such albums as BLACKOUT. Spears is the epitome of what's wrong in music now-days.. She had only one thing going for her in the past, her dance moves.. All she does is lip-sync and hardly does anything worth praising, musically. She is as lame and lifeless as a plastic barbie doll except barbie is easier on the eyes. Now that she cant even dance-lyp-sync in her performance (mtv vmas 07) she is nothing! Her handlers-producers are the only ones we should be merriting on BLACKOUT.. i give the production an 8.. however britneys lifeless robotic chants bring this album to a non-reputable place, unworthy of her possession.. Its sad really to think that this lady here gets money from these lost gay men and lost little teenage girls who know nothing better then to listen to this iconic repression of real talent, Ms. Spears.. aka no talent, period!
I might give the producers a 3 or 4, but I can't give Britney that, because she did not contribute to this "work" that holds her name. If it takes processed computer voice effects to hide your lack of talent, and you have to hire a team of people write the songs, a team of people to choose from the songs you didn't contribute to, and along the way tick off your writers by not returning thier calls, and otherwise blunder your way through what is really not even your own album, you probably deserve a 0. Hopefully the end of her.
This is a horrible album. The sad part is, Britney had very little involvement in the project at all. It is scary tot think how bad this album would be if she actualy attempted to write and produce the entire album.
Britney can't sing, and the lyrics are mostly lame. Some pretty good production is what keeps this album from being a complete disaster.
um, it's Britney Spears...she's been a complete joke for years.
This Album Simply Sucks
Praise for this album centers on how great the dance tracks are, once again proving that many critics have a generally poor knowledge of the dance music scene. Everything on this album has been done better elsewhere--sometimes even with the help of the very same producers--on dance albums in the last two years.
I shudder to think that people actually like this trash. It's a perfect example of Ms. Spears herself. Trashy, cheap, noisy and useless. The only song worth dancing to is Gimme More. The rest of the album is shockingly bad and prooves that her air head fans will buy anything with her name on it. The whole album conjures up images if a fithy, dive of a bar where you will end up with an STD when you wake up the next day.
I really wanted this album to be good, really I did. But this is BEYOND bad. There is only about two songs on it that are good. Her vocals are horrible, and the whole album is wayyyy over-produced. Once again, she had a chance to make a comeback, prove something, but sadly she let everyone down.....again.
Its just sad, it is a true statement on the current condition of the music industry. A record can be sold not on the merrit of its music but rather on how much tabloid covers the artist (if you can even call her that) is on. The reason people have bought this album is curriosity and nothing more, there is no depth to her music. Spears is a dinasuar and a hold over from the 90's who unlike many of her contemporaries is unable to evolve with the times and change her imiage as well as her musical style to show any maturity or creativty. THose people who bought her music years ago have grown up, so why cant she? Many pop artist have been able to change and evolve with the times and still stay relevent and poplular while showing great depth, but it seems that spears (or should i say the people who controle her or tell her what to do) wish not to take a risk and stick to the same formula she used when she was 17 (Low browl radio friendly sexuality that boarders more on cheap back alley prositition then it does on true sex appeal, easy to digest none complicated dance beats, and simple verse chorus verse song structure, all in a simple 4 minute or less radio format) The use of auto tuner on this record is sickening, it just goes to show how many in the music industry use the studio not as a tool to enhance the artist and the music but as a crutch to support them and hide their all to evident flaws. This is all to visible in her inability to perform her own music on stage (let alone fake it) Since when was it more important to dance then sing in the context of populat music? Is her music that shallow that people go to the shows to see crappy dancing (if she was a good dancer she wouldnt need coreographers to tell her every sigle move to make on stage) rather then listen to the music. She is nothing but a little doll that record exucutives hope to wind up and play so they can try to save their failing industry. The 90's are over and so is this farce that has been sold to us as something resemballing talent. Spears needs to stick to what she is good at, being tabloid fauder
are you kidding? people think that this is her greatest album ever?!! do not waste your money on this trash, and i'm not talking about her personal life. the music is boring, monotonous, stupid and annoying. britney fans should go back and listen to her other cds, when she was in control of her life, and tell the difference.

Absolutely terrible.
15 songs of nothing!
Horrid.
Very disappoint record... its not britney anymore.. its only a bunch f producers doing their thing and britneys voice on the track, sucks!!!
absolute and complete garbage. Britney has no talent at all, whatever talent she USED to have evidently disinigrated into an abusive talentless alcholic partying awful mother who cant sing, cant dance and cant keep a man.If u see this cd in stores THROW IT ON THE GROUND AND STEP ON IT...you may be saving someone from 60 mins of dookey.
She is a horrible human being and a rotten musical artist. Jessica Simpson has more integrity and soul!
On a daily basis, it's utterly horrendous. Her voice was never her strength, and it's worse now. It gets a three because the beats are, at the very least, good enough for clubs. However, I would walk out of a club if her music is being forced into my ears.

One of the worst albums of the year thus far. It shows absolutely no artistic growth, the lyrics are elementary, and the vocals are non-existent. All in all, a terrible album.
Blackout la segunda biblia del pop de Britney Spears, demostrando que podía innovar de nuevo en la música, a lado de Danja siendo un excelente equipo, crearon así uno de los álbumes más influyentes del siglo XXI, aunque en su tiempo no fue tan valorado por el público, actualmente es una obra maestra que muchos han intentado copiar.
um album revoluncionario que moldou a musica pop atual, sendo o melhor trabalho de britney spears
I think it's great! Fun and consistent. Love the album cover. The whole album has energy. Everybody lighten up.
this is a very good album, fresh, pop, dance, maybe is no the best of britney but i love it
Britney is back!!!!....The album gives awesome dance tracks from start to finsih......say what you will about her personal life, but let the music speak for itself......and it delivers, time and again!
I was never a fan, except for the bounciness of Toxic & the pathos of Something, I never gave much thought about Ms Britney, that is, until she shaved her head. What a great show of defiance! Can you imagine Nelly Furtado or any of the top 10 female pop performers doing the same out of some bizarre emotional self-confrontation? As for the album - if you're a fan of Ladytron-Depeche Mode you'd be pleasantly surprised.
Great album, Britney improved her music since In The Zone.
Some of my best work y'all!
This album is great. All the songs, that's right, all of them, are great. Very dance-like. I recommend it to anyone.
It is her best album yet. The songs are funky and futuristic. All of the bizarre voice she uses like in Get Naked (I Got A Plan) and Freakshow work to her advantage. The dance club hits like Gimme More and Radar make this cd a huge success.
I cannot believe it. No, really. I dislike Britney's music, I usually find it way too stupid. "Blackout" is not the exception: it is probably the most stupid thing you've heard... after "Spice up your life" perhaps. But the truth is that this piece of stupid music is amazingly funny! It's not the kinda album I'm gonna listen to over and over. But you can be sure that you can play it on a party, and it will work. Oh, and "Hot as ice" is the biggest nonsense I've heard in my life. And I just can't help lovin' it.
Awesome come back album!!!!
Of Course, Britney's best work i think, all the song is modern, up-tempo and electric! a typically R&B/Pop disc :) i love it! BRITNEY B***h is back.
And yes this album is fabulous.
Britney's much anticipated album doesn't fail to deliver. This album is very well produced and one can't help but be caught in the hynotic and yet playful beats that Britney's crew carve out. One needs wonder whether this is just slick production or a smart plan by the former good girl now ubiquitous star credited as executive producer. A great pop dance album with many beats destined for radio and chart success.
Amazing!
Really... i just had to give this album a 10. its just too good. no fillers AT ALL. and my idols are tori amos and bjork. please guys.. give ratings to THIS ALBUM.. not her life or whatever that bugs you.. buy this record and enjoy.
Perfectly produced and sang: Spears' voice sounds amazing on beats by Danja, Bloodshy & Avant and others. Her best album so far.
Britney's best album yet.
Very well done for someone so troubled. Shows that no matter how crazy you go, if you have an ear for excellent pop, that ain't gonna leave. Standouts for me are Heaven On Earth, Freakshow, Perfect Lover and the bonus track Outta This World. Every song is good in some way though, and this album sounds AMAZING if you play it blaring loud in your car during summer with the windows down. Well done Britney, now get well soon!
Whilst her voice isn't very deserving of praise9lets face it the nasal sound can be giot from kindergartners!!) this album is just enjotable and for once she doesn't appeaar to be fixed at the mic her voice whether good or bad is shown. Not bad!
Welcome back, Britney, we missed you! Blackout shocked me from start to finish. At first, I thought: "Oh, crap, another comeback album." But it's more. It's a defiant, in-your-face sucker punch to the media's gut. Full of catchy beats, unusual synth sounds, and fearlessly sexy lyrics, Blackout may just be Britney's best work yet. Piece Of Me, Gimme More, and Break The Ice are the best tracks, but Toy Soldier and Freakshow are well done, too.
I absolutely LOVE every song on the album!
brilliant electro pop. girl gonna WORK.
her best album yet.
Anyone who doesn't like this album has no business in dance music or having fun. Don't people GET IT? She is a DANCE artist. She does not make sappy love ballads & her voice isn't strong like Mariah or Celine's, yet people always belittle her because of that. If, say, Madonna or Kylie made an album like this, it would have gotten 5/5 stars everywhere. And people complaining about the overproduced vocals? Are you kidding? IT IS A DANCE ALBUM, IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE ROBOTIC AND ELECTRONIC-INFLUENCED. Have you guys ever heard of DAFT PUNK?! Each song is a classic and I must say it is becoming one of my favorite albums ever.
I Love it! great album.
This album is abfab! Highlights: Gimme More, Piece of Me, Radar, Get Nacked.
This CD is my far her best yet, not only does every song have an extremely catchy beat but it reflects so much on her life. I think she did a wonderful job with this anyone who disagrees obviously does not like that genre of music or is being too critical, yes she has made some bad decisions put that behind you, this was a great move on her part!
Don't want to endorse her right now, but she definitely put out a great pop album. Lots of fun.
buck the naysayers ... the album is choc full of songs to shake your @$$ to and beats to bob your head to. I mean, seriously, if I only bought music from artists whose personal lives I related to, I wouldn't own more than a handful of albums! the songs are well crafted for anyone w/an ear for ELECTRO-POP/DANCE music. and I'm one of those people!
Not bad. Is a album for dance and clubbing times.
really awesome album - sexy, dancy, well produced - brits best - love the attitude and energy.
Hmm. never liked britney b4, but some of these songs are, i grudgingly admit, quite brilliant, and very avant garde. 'piece of me' is better and more futuristic than a lot of electronic bands (Digitilism, Underworld, etc.) which was a shock. And the song Freakshow is nearly as good as SXYLV, Lava Lava, or D.A.N.C.E. Also, reading the New York Times reveiw, I'm suprised metacritic counts it as only a 40, when reads more like a 75 to me, especially with quotes like this: "That doesn
GREAT ALBUM!
wow! superb! get into her beat
Britney's best album yet.
Awesome!
This is one of the best album of the decade. this album is a huge hit. i feel like dancing to all the tracks.
i actually think this album is fun, different and artfully crafted to kiss off her image as a bad parent, drug addict, trainwreck and forces us to realize why we loved britney before....her music...not her voice, her music. i think this is a great way of proving she hasn't gone completely crazy!
It's her best material in career! Every songs is a hit!!!
Love it !
BLA BLA BLA . This Shit is the Hottest ALBUM EVER , if u r saying that she used Studi Tricks Thats SUPER COOL , She have ha Showed her abilities On - Hot As Ice - Heaven On Earth - An i really Dont Carfe about if Her Voice wasn't 100 Clear , BRITNEY HAVE MADE A HELL OF A COPMEBACK.
Mix Timberlake's FurtureSex/LoveSound and Madonna's Confessions On A Dancefloor, with Britney's Derriere... Puf! The Best Dance Album Of The Year!!!
Funny that Britney delivered her best album when least expected. Never thought I would hear a great album from the "Oops I did it again" girl.
Blackout rocks!! It's amazing. Britney's best album! She keeps getting better and better. She is the executive producer of blackout. She made an awesome album!
This is her best album to date. Judge her for the music, not for the personal life!!!
hate the cover and the inside pics but love the album. loved "heaven on earth" and 'piece of me'
Britney knows what she excels at and she delivers it here on Blackout. Most every song is a get out of your seat and dance groove. Those looking for personal, introspective lyrics have come to the wrong place. Maybe on the next album.
So Britney needs a lot of help in her personal life?! BUT BOY DOES SHE KNOW HOW TO MAKE A POP RECORD! This album is great and touches on her paprazzi filled life and sexual growth as a person! Hight lights: "Radar", "Gimme More", "Get Naked", "Toy Soldier", "Break The Ice", "Ooh Ooh Baby", "Piece of Me"-- this album will sure get your booty dancin and having a blast!!! (but really Get Help Britney in your personal life)
she will always have it!!!!
she fine. and she could sing
I love it...every track is incredible...
metacritic needs to post more reviews - like the AP review that called it a "triumph." it is a better "all the way through" listen than futuresex/lovesounds. this has no lame ballads (except maybe the last song, but even that isn't so bad) and amazing production on basically every track. she can't sing, but she never could, so who cares about that. the producers make her voice do cool things, and the beats are hot.
Most critics are reviewing her personal Blackout not her professional one.This album is Great & they know it. I'm not a Britney fan but she deserves credit when it's due. This is her sexy adult debut & i love it.
Far better than it should be. A testament to Brit-Brit's puppeteers.
I wrote Britney off a few months ago. I wasn't going to buy her album until someone suggested it to me. I love it, shamelessly. It is that good. The beats + her voice, the oversexed lyrics, the word play from all her paparazzi coverage...LOVE it. I can't wait to listen to it again.
This is unlistenable trash.
Shockingly good. I was prepared to hate it and encountered a surprise. Very upbeat, very well-produced, very fun.
This is a great album, with great music. It is outstanding in the fact that it gets you to get up and dance. There isn't a single song that you would want to skip over. A perfect collection for getting the spirit up. no doubt a 10/10
It's a very good album and easily the best one she's put out.
Very well produced. Overall a really solid dance record.
I wasn't a Huge Fan of her, but after hearing this Album, I am her new Fan. THis album is kill people, Do not miss it, all the tracks are a Hit for me!
Radar is awesome!!!!!! I am pretty sure it will be another #1 single too. It's good.
lmfao at the people who are just rating it a zero without even hearing it. I'm betting it's the Christina fans, or the Jessica fans who have flopped so hard with so much promotion while Britney' album keeps going up, up, UP on the charts with no promotion, and just a video promoting the album. Don't be mad. Britney has sold 83 million albums in her 10 year career, and another 35 million singles sold worldwide. Britney has sold more than all these rejects combined!
This is a legend should sound like One of the good album welcome back Britney.
The usual Britney fare is here. There's high-production and the myriad of maestros do their job, but the lyrics remain completely insipid (save for one track). It's designed for a bubbly audience that laps up anything with a consistent thump-thump, for people who could care less that what she's saying makes no sense, that the music is a bandwagon approach to what's "hot" at the moment, or -- most importantly -- that she didn't write any of it herself. Britney is interchangeable, as anybody could do her job, leaving her in the status of a guilty pleasure. It's more an ode to producer's talents than anything. Check it out if you're into music with a glossy sheen, but if you want pop with substance go elsewhere.
Britney's best album yet. Very good from beginning to end.
Very well made. i didn't expect such a good album after all that happened to her recently. nice record - from the beginning to the end
it's true, Ms. Spears is BACK!! Despite an displeasing performance at the 2007 VMAs her first single, "gimme more, " was an instant hit! it's catchy, it's sexy, it's fresh-- It's GREAT!! The single paved the way on what to expect from her latest production on which she received help from some of the hottest producers in the industry. The songs are all hyped-up, dance-ready jams! so if you are looking for a cd to dance to, this is IT.
if Ailleen Wournos that psycho woman made an album this is what it would sound like, its completely demented. the sound of someone thats lost their mind. im giving it a ten for its level of insanity.
This isn't a bad pop album. It definitely beats the latest by the likes of Rihanna and Gwen Stefani, but doesn't have the continuity and enjoyability of Madonna or Nelly Furtado.
People have to put aside absolutely everything that is going on in Britney's life and just focus on her music right now, as it is the only thing that matters and the only thing that people have the right to make their business and critique...and her new album, "Blackout," is the best album Spears has put out to date. Her debut was cute from beginning to end, and the subsequent albums have produced some of the best pop singles of the last ten years, but were filled with filler. "Blackout" is her first album that is filler-free and every track is strong. From the excellent comeback single "Gimme More" (which would be doing better if people would stop playing personal tabloid and just enjoy it for what it is), to the brilliant "Piece of Me," the Gwen-Stefnesque "Toy Soldier" to one of her best recordings to date, "Heaven on Earth." Britney, I wish you all the best with your stuff, but professionally, you're return is welcomed with open arms. Masterful.
britney rules!
I don't think that she's doing her best, but i like the album.
Amazing. You might not like her actions but she knows how to make catchy tunes to sell albums. i need poppy dance music in my life - there is too much negativity in the world.
Please forget all the Britney you see all over E!. She may lead a weird life, but don't they all? I could care less about any artists personal life. If they make good music...I am happy. If you continually trash someone you are no saint either. This CD is probably one of the best pop albums ever. Whoever is responsible for it. It may take me a year to get over it. Maybe then I will stop listening to it. No, probably not! People take other people's lives way too seriously these days. I just need good music. So, thank you, Britney, Danja, Bloodshy & Avant, etc.!!!
I loooove it!! it's Brittie's Best Job so Far!!! it's Danceable, catchy, Grown Up, and Sexy!! 3 words : Hot as Ice!!!
Still, and not surprisingly so, I have yet to be more amused at something than at the STUPID people in here who in doing what they do best, squabble, twist and turn the average review score by their useless voting and commenting. F First of all, let me praise all of you that can actually resent to judge an album based on it's quality and not based on the amount of drugs inhaled and/or injected prior to recording. Next, let me LAUGH at you useless dogs which qualify yourself to speak badly of a woman you barely know: How in earth do you know how much involvement Britney may have had in the album? If you want to squabble anymore about this and as a consequence of this give poor Britney a 0, please do this on gossipmsn. There's lots of fools like you there. As Rob B excellently states: "Her Music????" What are you people talikng(?) about. She doesn't write a thing. She's a product" I am sorry. Let me be like you. Britney's vocals are not as good as they used to be and therefore I give an 8/10 based on good, light-headed and entertaining music that will indeed rush clubs as alot of other average club music has done. Nicely produced.
Best Pop Album of the year. Go figure. Intresting drving rhythms & experimental (for Brit) places that she has never taken the music before. Her best. Like sitting in Jack Ruby's bar while high on Ecstasy.
If they make good music???? Her Music???? What are you people talikng about. She doesn't write a thing. She paid a bunch of people to write her an album and you people are giving her credit. She's a product ..... of course if you people love this album so are you.
Considering I never really enjoyed Brittney before, I was quite taken back by the quality of production and almost cutting edge electro pop beats and sounds. Each song is with ease better than anything she has released as single before, with maybe the exception of Toxic, which was class. Who cares if its mainly producers who have made this good? Good music is good music, so lets be happy there is so much of it on one CD, and its from Britney Spears, weird, but true!
Ugh, I'll never understand how people can enjoy "music" like this.
Best dance album out. Loved Britney From the start but now, this is a like breathe of fresh air coming through her music. Devine
An album that deserves to blasted for all 12 tracks. No denying it. Britney is on top of her game. Congratulations!
this is her best album so far!!! Amazing and catchy songs.
I don't know why MetaCritic lists this album as "61". The album has got GREAT reviews, practically across the board. This album is not a disappointment, it's a party from start to finish and only ONE song "Hot As Ice" I would consider filler. Pop album of the year!
great album! and im not a britney fan...
Excellent album. "Freakshow" is like her best song yet!
I don't know why people are making a huge deal over this album. a wonderfully produced, dance-ready album! leave it alone, stop with all of the negative comments. if you're not of fan of Britney's than just don't buy it and SHUT THE FUCK UP!! i mean please, its not like your opinion is going to influence anybody!!
Despite her best efforts - Britney has not destroyed her career. This album is surprisingly good. Scratch that great. for what it is - you can't get much better. Fun, bubble gum pop that you can't help but dance to. "Radar" "Piece of Me" and "Gimme More" are stand outs but the best is "Toy Soldier" which should be a HUGE dance club hit.
It's Britney bitch! And you can't deny the fact that this album rocks! She has returned to the pop scene with her best album yet. All the songs are great and dance worthy. You will not find yourself hating any od the songs at all. Among the new group of songs, the once that stand out the most are "Toy Soldier", "Gimme More", "Piece of Me" and "Radar". This are not the only great songs however. All the songs will get you up from your seat and just rock out. Go Britney!!!!
Is this for real? Tell me this is a joke...
i looovvveee it. britney is da best haters deal with it :] da queen of pop always a true legend
I love it.
Great Album, with the exception of "Heaven On Earth"...But, Obviously, Not Her Best Work.
Bad!! If I wolud have heard it before I wouldn't have bought it!!
Unlike her previous albums, this one doesn't contain those songs that make you instantly want to skip to the next track. While it still sounds like all the talent is in the producer's twiddling the knobs, they did a very good job of twiddlin' this time around. This same disc could have been made with studio musicians with no discernible difference in its sound, but for pure pop its on the upper end of listenable. I never thought I'd say that about a Britney album.
The people who keep doubting Britney just keep on getting pushed further in the mud by her ever growing incredible dance music. That are also memorable. Britney is a legend, and not just in the joking kind of way like people on Livedaily keep saying about Crustina. Blackout is amazing. Gimme More, Piece of Me, Radar, Break the Ice, Heave on Earth, Get Naked, Freakshow, Toy Soldier, Ooh Ooh Baby, Perfect Lover, and Why Should I be Sad are all A+ tracks from an A+ artist.
Overall there are a lot of great tracks on the album, but when listening you get the feeling she just doesn't care about the music anymore.
Amazing!
GREAT ALBUM!
Britney is awesome and will always be awesome. Ive been listening to her ever since baby one more time came out and this album is even more amazing than all of her other work. Everyone out there hating on her needs to get a life and chill the fuck out. She'll grow out of this awful post-divorce funk and her hair will grow back. This album will bring Britney back! GO BRIT!!!!!
I can't stand this girls music BUT this CD blew me away ! WOW !!!
The best album of her career so far? Absolutely.This and Kylie Minogue's 'X' are two of best examples how good and understated modern electro-pop can and should be. Much like 'X', the producers are very much in control here, but Britney's distinctiveness shines through. It's one of those beautiful records that after maybe 10 spins suddenly makes sense. You realise how well structured and expertly produced it really is. Not all pop albums need to be loud to big and exciting.
THIS IS SO OUTTA THIS WORLD THE BEST BRITNEY ALBUM EVER AND FEMME FETALE IS SO GOOD TOO!!!!!! the songs so amazing were Perfect Lover, Piece of Me, Toy Soldier and Gimme gimme more gimme more!!!!!!
Depois de um período conturbado em sua carreira, Britney volta 4 anos depois do seu último lançamento, ”In The Zone”. Entre este período, Britney Spears simplesmente casou, separou, teve filhos e passou por um momento delicado em sua carreira: teve toda sua vida exposta e era constante flagrada se envolvendo em polêmicas e muita confusão. Spears nos traz muito mais que nós poderíamos esperar para o seu retorno. Essencialmente com produção de Danja e Bloodshy & Avant, ”Blackout” traz o seu material mais maduro até então, um álbum coeso do começo ao fim; diferente do que vinha a acontecer em sua vida, ”Blackout” vem com mais acertos que erros.No fim dos anos 90, Britney Spears surgiu como um estouro teen, ao lado de seus amigos do ”Clube do Mickey”, Justin Timberlake de N*Sync e Christina Aguilera. A faixa ”Baby One MOre Time”, que traçou o topo dos Estados Unidos por 2 semanas e o seu disco homônimo vendeu mais 25 milhões de cópias ao redor do planeta, mas agora em 2007, Britney traz como carro chefe, ”Gimme More”, com o forte bordão ”It’s Britney **** uma faixa dance urbana que a distancia ainda mais a cantora do universo teen que a consagrou e aproxima Britney das divas pop Kylie Minogue e Madonna. Em ”Piece of Me”, Britney diz que é o sonho americano desde seus 17 anos e faz uma crítica aos paparazzis que a todo momento estão a clicando atrás de uma nova manchete nos tablóides e as pessoas que por este movito, julgam-lhe cosntantemente: ”Não vejo problema em trabalhar e ser mãe (…) vocês querem um pedaço de mim?”. Em ”Radar”, Britney tem o homem dos seus sonhos em sua mira, em ”Break The Ice”, melhor faixa do disco e em ”Get (Naked I Got A Plan)”, Spears também tem o desejo de conquistar e entrar em sintonia com seu parceiro (”Eu nunca me senti assim, você deixou o meu coração bater feito um sintetizador” / ”Nós somos adultos agora, eu faço você descongelar… Vamos pegar fogo.” – canta Britney em ”Break The Ice”). ”Heaven on Earth” nos traz direto ao ótimo ”Confessions on A Dance Floor” de Madonna, com uma inspiração na era disco de Donna Summer e Giorgio Moroder.A única faixa assinada por Britney Spears, ”Freakshow”, Britney simplesmente diz que quer sacodir o bumbum na pista de dança e deixar as garotas morrendo de inveja, a faixa traz uma novidade conhecida hoje como ”dubstep”, recurso eletrônico que seria ainda mais ampliado em popularidade em sua faixa número 1 de 2011, ”Hold It Against Me” e pelo multi-Grammy winner Skrillex. O álbum passa pelas não tão ótimas ”Toy Soldier”, ”Hot As Ice”, ”Ooh Ooh Baby” e melhora em ”Perfect Lover” e ”Why Should I Be Sad”, a última assinada por Pharrell Williams e The Neptunes, que nos remete a ótima ”Boys” de seu disco anterior.Não é a toa que ”Blackout” é um dos discos mais influentes dos últimos anos, em um mundo ainda pre-Lady Gaga, Britney Spears representa o pop dos anos 2000 com muita ousadia e se reafirma como uma mulher agora mãe, talvez mais madura e eternamente como a princesa do pop.
Best album Britney has ever recorded. Every single track is a standout except for Everybody, which is only a bonus track. Most songs are some of the best dance tracks you will ever find in a pop album. This is the album that Lady Gaga and others looked up to for their releases. Favourite songs include Gimme More, Break the Ice, Heaven on Earth.
I prefer to have emotion in my music, but seeing as this is Britney Spears, and that entails dance tracks that makes you want to hit the club . . . I will make an exception.Highlights (for me) are "Gimme More" ("It's Britney, B**ch), "Break the Ice" ("So you warming up yet?"), "Get Naked (I Got A Plan)" ("If ya like what ya see, end your curiosity"), "Freakshow" ("But if they wanna look, we can give 'em a encore"), "Toy Soldier" ("This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier"), "Ooh Ooh Baby" ("Your voice is like music to my ears, whisper softly and the world just dissapears"), and "Get Back" ("If you can't take it then get back").
O álbum mais provocativo de Britney Spears, a vez que ela cansou de ser um produto e realmente mostrou o que a incomodava, toda a exposição revelada, e agora morena ela joga um foda-se a todos, com faixas 'Gimme More', 'Piece Of Me', 'Break The Ice', um álbum diferente de tudo que ela tava fazendo.E tudo isso chega ao movimento #FREEBRITNEY, depois de anos vemos que ela ainda não se livrou dessa indústria magnata, e continua sendo vista como um produto, que ela consiga se livrar dos 'inimigos' e realmente se encontre sua felicidade, e um tempo para si #FREEBRITNEY.
Um super comeback após uma fase difícil, Blackout é sem dúvida um marco na indústria musical. Foi responsável pela popularização do eletropop, junto com X de Kylie Minogue, que reina até hoje.
Simply put, her most bold, edgy and dark work yet, he employs a wide spectrum of glorious synths and goes from an electronic, processed vocoder effect on some songs, to showcasing her amazing vocals effortlessly on others, like Gimme More.
Com certeza o melhor álbum da carreira de Britney Spears. Mesmo em uma época conturbada de sua vida, Britney conseguiu entregar um material de altíssima qualidade. Blackout foi inspiração de álbuns pop de outros artistas.
her most outstanding album to date. filled to the brim with r&b infused dance-pop (Hot as Ice, Gimme More, Toy Soldier, Break the Ice), buoyant synthpop (Radar, Outta This World), and the most fabulous song of her career thus far, the icy and sensual love song Heaven on Earth, which is a splendid hybrid of Donna Summer and Eurythmics-esque aural textures. A+ Brit
Excellent album, Bible de la pop, cet album expérimental est un des meilleurs albums de Britney. Un mélange de sons et d'ambiance qui vous feront danser ou rêver.Point négatif: le choix du 1er single ainsi que les deux pistes qui clôturent l'album.
By far, one of the best albums of the early 2000's. This is pure pop excellence. Britney truly delivered vocal talent and pure emotion with this album. Gimme More is the perfect start for this album, serving pure sex and attitude. Radar and Break The Ice are other top songs from this fantastic album
Sinceramente no se que le ven, es malo, y aunque tiene momentos de gloria, no me gusta casi, solo los singles y uno que otra cancion se salvan, no me gusto para nada
É um bom album, mas não é tudo isso, tem otimas musicas como Gimme More, Piece Of Me, Break The Ice e Everybody, mas eu ainda continuo preferindo Circus, In The Zone, Femme Fatale, Britney, Glory etc...
Como em 1999, Novamente Britney revoluciona o Pop, desta vez ela trás o Electropop em uma forma sexual a la poli dance aonde todas as musicas te fazem querer dançar até o sol raiar, todas as musicas estão bem pessoais e bem profissional.
I really love this album is my favoriteeeee from britney, i think she make the pop better and she always save the pp with her music's e reallyyy loooove
Spears' sophomore album, which was critically one of her best, and featured the self-titled single that everyone and their mothers know. The album is headlined by such songs as Oops...I did it again, Stronger, and Lucky, with each one reaching the top 15 in the US Billboard 100 charts. Though those songs were popular, and I think they are catchy, the album does have its flaws. (I can't get no) Satisfaction is a word-for-word cover of the original Rolling Stones song, and it just comes off as awful personally. Also, the last track on the album, Dear Diary, is very, very stupid, in my opinion. Buy it to relive some nostalgia, but be aware this is the early 2000's, and bubblegum pop is just as cheesy as you thought it was.
It's Britney **** that says it all... there's something magical about it that you listen to it in 2016 and it still sounds fresh and avant-guard, No other Britney album will reach the standards this one set!
It's Britney **** This is a great album that truly makes history in pop industry. It really express herself in that moment and adds an originality that few artists are capable of. Even though she abuses of the autotune, she still rules this industry.
Rarely does a pop album deserve a 10/10 rating. This is that album.A nonstop party from the very opening line ("It's Britney, **** and continuing seamlessly until the album's conclusion consisting of a post-KFed kiss-off ("Why Should I Be Sad?"), Blackout is truly the consummate dance-pop record.Over a decade since its release, and yet the songs not only fail to sound outdated, but seem as though they could be released today and receive an overwhelmingly positive response. The music is timeless, and Britney at her best.Although this is probably the only CD wherein I fail to routinely skip any tracks; there are certainly stand-outs nevertheless:"Gimme More""Break The Ice""Heaven On Earth""Ooh Ooh Baby," andbonus track "Get Back" shine even more brightly than the others.While there may not be a standout pop anthem a la "Baby One More Time," "Oops!...I Did It Again" or "Toxic," this album is by far Britney's most cohesive and mature material. It's not an album you purchase for the singles, but rather the experience of the record in its entirety.10/10.
Britney's early career appeared unfocused. However, on Blackout, Brit seemed to have found her niche. Blackout blends elements of electronic and pop music to create beats that make Britney feel right at home. Nothing is more iconic than the opening line of "Gimme More", which sets the tone of the album: "It's Britney, b*tch." The standout tracks are the pulsing "Get Naked"; the sassy "Piece of Me"; the atmospheric "Break the Ice"; and the trippy, dubstep-influenced "Freakshow."
Much like In The Zone, this is a consistent and generally interesting record, but NOT the pop bible, and NOT even close to a great record. Very good: Break the Ice, Heaven on Earth. Good: Most of the rest.
No es lo mejor que he escuchado, muy sobrevalorado para lo que en realidad es

Devoted fans, we're still waiting for a BLACKOUT 2.0. Probably never happens, but she did delivered of one the most ahead of its time album. Nate Hills & Britney Spears, good pair.
Her best album so far! And one of the best albums of 2007, and the decade.Gimme More is so 2010s and Break The Ice has a incredible tempo, that makes me dance everytime I hear it. Great.
BRILLIANT. AWESOME SURPRISINGLY MODERN POP ALBUMThis is the album that started all the modern pop trends we see today. Even though its call electro pop you can hear trap, dubstep and new wave on this album. It really is awesome and addictive filled with hedonistic lyrics and hyptonic dance beats.
is an album with absolutely all the good songs, an album directed to any audience
An iconic album, the princess of pop has the most important album of this milennium
I'm bored. I don't think I could listen to this while being blackout drunk. It seems as though Spears was when she recorded the album. At least I understand the title.
her best album. period. 11 years and it still feels like it's released just now.
Extremely different to her previous album, "In the zone", but she pulled this change off pretty well. My favorites on this flawless album include "Gimme more", "Heaven on earth", "Ooh ooh baby" and "Break the ice".
Will pop ever be this well packaged again? This statement isn't to shade current pop stars or disregard their own contributions but the digestible one dimensional dance ready pop gems seem to be fewer and fewer. A forefather to the sweet ease of "teenage dream" or any release of the early tens. From the iconic "It's Britney **** " of "Gimme more" to the cool sultry seduction of break the ice. The while record is a highlight ,taking risks and veering into the oddest places to find gems such as "get back" &"why should I be sad"It can be seen as a hedonistic dissertation on the pressures of fame . From the cautionary justified paranoia ("Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin' / They keep watchin', keep watchin'") or the pj harvey reminiscent "piece if me " delivered in a near spoken biographical manner. A poignant revelation on the reasons of her publicized break down&exploitation. The dubstep pulse of freak show revels in the prison of media. Flirting with the idea of fame being a power just aa much as it is a curse, the influence and worship that come with the paparazzi. "Hot as ice" steals the show in the high register Britney owning her destructive nuances and "perfect lover " sums up the competive vortex of consumerist fame(""Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot") which is a clock reference at the 11th song before the denouement of "why should i be sad?" At 12. Rounding off the standard edition. Britney spears best album album. Favourites: break the ice, gimme more,hot as ice, why should i be sad&piece of me
Crazy how she managed to release her best album in such a dark period of her life, one of the GREATEST pop records of the 21st century.
Um dos melhores álbuns da Britney e falo isso com tranquilidade, mostrando o porque de ela ser considerada a princesa do pop.
This is the best album of the world
Su mejor album , debió tener más reconocimiento.Una biblia del pop , Britney la princesa del pop por siempre.
Her best album period.Perfect Lover is my favorite track I think.Way ahead of it's time Blackout is definitely one of the best pop albums ever made.Spears is a genius.
a timeless album way ahead of it's time which paved the way for a lot of music nowadays!
One of the best albuns of her career. Rolling Stone review in fact. Danja doing his best job
One of the most cohesive, iconic albums i’ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. The production is a masterpiece and the album was a head of it’s time.
Hermosa la biblia del pop, el mejor álbum del Pop, del 2007 y de Ms Britney Spears.
Blackout became in the most influential album of the 2000s decade, that still have impact the 2010s decade.Spears' album introduce dupstep and underground EDM music to mainstream pop, sound that was rejected in the beginning by the critics but was the objective that every other pop star wants to follow.Blackout is a perfect dance pop album, that includes low-key personal references about Spears' personal life such as Piece of Me and Why Should I Be Sad.
Blackout is Britney's biggest act in music. It is a pop bible and reference to new generations. Popularized dubstep and rhythms that were forgotten. The vocals are clean and their compositions strong. Piece of me and Gimme More are extremely strong and will be remembered for eternity. She became a legend.
o maior e mais influente album dos anos 2000. felizmente a princesa do pop, a surra na gorduxa que só tem 2 albuns verdinhos
Blackout é um cd muito divertido com ótimas composições um dos meus trabalhos preferidos.
Her best album ever! It's so underrated. Advanced produced and nice melody and vocals
Su mejor álbum, biblia del pop!!!
This is one of those albums we are going to listen in the future and say: that was what pop looked like. Britney gives us this "Britney B**ch" persona which we dive in during the whole album. There are ups, as Gimme More, Piece of Me and Radar, which actually were singles, and some other hidden songs with a lot of potential like Hot as Ice and Get Back. For me, only Freakshow should have been kept as draft and the most forgettable song. The lyrical content is fantastic and tells a lot about the industry. Those are critics we can still see up to today.
It is a wonderful album!!! Many artist have been inspired by this album. I love it
Blackout is the bible of pop-music. This album is very depressive and daring but provocational. Gimme more, Piece of me is the best song. Come back princess of pop
10 e se pudesse dava mais, não é todo dia que temos uma bíblia pop que definiu gerações como esse álbum.
Album da minha vida! Melhor album da Britney ❤❤ Ela se superou muito nesse album, escutem!
En el momento más oscurobde su vida logró brillar pese a que su vida personal estaba revuelta, blackout es el disco más influyente de las últimas 2 décadas y al no contar con ninguna balada simplemente es delirante
Es el mejor álbum de 2007. Trajo un sonido nuevo y cambio el rumbo del Pop. Marco un ante su después. Es la Biblia del Pop y merece respeto. Sin este álbum no hay nada de lo que conocemos ahora
If I could find a word to describe this album, that would be: psychedelic. Spears tried to give us another sexy album, but she couldn´t do it like in its predecessor "In The Zone". Maybe it´s the eletropop vibe mixed with a big amount of unnecessary autotune, that just doesn´t click. "Gimme More" is definitely the edge of this project, bringing us Britney at her best.
Genuinely an impactful and solid pop album. Every song is great. The production is amazing and quite varied, as well as the vocal performance. Looking back it’s apparent just how impactful this album was. It ushered in a new sound to pop music, paving the way for artists like Lady Gaga, Kesha, Carly Rae, Dua lipa, etc.
Biblia del pop, que mal que en su momento no haya sido valorado, se convirtió en el álbum más influyente de los últimos tiempos.
Her best album, literally the best album in the world. Princess of pop!!!! Period
pop perfection. the bible of pop. without it pop music wouldn't have been the same it was during 2008-2012. it still influences a lot of nowadays music
my favorite album of hers! my favorite songs on the album are: piece of me and gimme me more
As a hardcore Brit fan I would say this is Britney's most revolutionary, seductive, personal and edgy album. Production is definitely ahead of its time... This masterpiece is for people who can truly appreciate and enjoy it.
blackout is called the bible of pop for a reason, it brought something new to the pop scene and completely revolutionized pop music, there’s no skips at all on this album.
Para mim, este é o melhor álbum dela, ela trouxe músicas maravilhosas e que você não cansa de ouvir.
It is called the "Bible of Pop" for a reason. Britney Spears knows how to make dance and killer songs like those in Blackout. Like how can one not jam to the songs like Gimme More, Piece of Me, Break the Ice, or Heaven on Earth? One of the best albums I've ever listened, and the best album of Britney.
This album is the hands-down best pop album of the 2000s. The iconic line "It's Britney **** sets you in the mood for this album like nobody else has done it before. All 14 tracks from this song are the best songs you will ever hear. Even the singles are perfect. Gimme More, Piece Of Me & Break The Ice. Just a Chief's kiss!
It’s the bible of pop, literally pop perfection, the best ever created! Britney did a great job as executive producer and she didn’t miss!
The production in this album is fascinating, and something Britney never did before. Almost every song is a smash. Combines futuristic and nostalgic sounds. Very unique pop record. Very fun listen to. The lyricism though is pretty generic, except of in songs like "Piece Of Me" which we never heard from her before.
Britney Spears changed pop with electronic sounds and would deliver several of pop's greatest hits.
Masterpiece from start to finish. This album deserves a Grammy plain and simple. This album paved the way for other pop artists.
Perfeito, coeso, incrível.Britney extremamente lendária. Concerteza uma obra prima jamais esquecida. Top 10 dos maiores e melhores álbuns de todos os tempos!!!
So, 2007 and Britney Spears had a breakdown because of the paparazzi refusing to deem her a human being, and she recorded Blackout. Blackout is one of her most diverse and most insane albums of her entire career. It has no ballads, which always bring a Britney album down a level, and the lyrics definitely aren't the hit there.Fav Track: Piece of Me, Gimme More, Get Naked, Toy SoldierWorst Track: Radar?, Freakshow, Why Should I Be Sad
A Bíblia do Pop. O MAIOR álbum de todos os tempos. Eu te venero, Britney Spears!
This album is the bible of pop, it's iconic, it has an incredible sound, beautiful songs, it's the best britney spears album in my opinion. My top 5:1.- Gimme More2.- Piece of Me3.- Radar4.-Break the Ice5.-Freakshow
Mejor álbum del pop. Una biblia literalmente. Grammy deserved y misunderstood en su tiempo. Britney te amo
this is the most amazing album ever made by a woman in this music industrylisten to this masterpiece please
Murphy is, efortlessly, the queen of electropop and this package of pitch-perfect gems is the living proof. Despite all the great reviews, I personally think it's never too much to remind how brilliant and glamorous this album is, in an era when new Gagas and Ke$has come out from nowhere every single day. My favourite pop album. Ever.
I think this album is brilliant,
Everything that's wrong with electronic music, all in one convenient package!
how Ruby Blue wasn't a huge success is nothing more than Roisin being too understated and naive in her marketing approach and confounding, its a great album. the songs off this Ive heard are lovely and fun, and will be buying soon as I'm paid. Roisin is cooler than most.
Fantastic!
This album is generally crafty electro-pop, showcasing Roisin's talent both lyrically & musically. Standout tracks include 'Let Me Know', 'Overpowered, 'Cry Baby' & 'Movie Star'.
Album of the year.
Gorgeously Sexy and a fantastic singer to boot. A highly varied album but with 7 or 8 top notch tracks, takes me back to when dance music was fresh in the mid 90's.
Nearly perfect.
To appreciate her music is to watch her videos. Let Me Know is an example of simple concept with a fun, pure hook. I'm just now digging into the album and so far it's a standout.
A really good pop gem. I liked Ruby Blue better but this album is almost as good even if it runs on a slightly different line. Why is Roisin Murphy still not a superstar?
Roisin Murphy is fantastic,she has a great voice,quirky sense of style,great modern electronic classic!!come on people discover her!!
Ruby Blue was excellent in that it offered gorgeous music and fun experimentation. Overpowered is excellent because Roisin has created electronic house/disco pop without sounding cold or calculated.
Roisin Murphy shows her essential contribution to the sound of modern music. Filled with inventive lyrics and music, Overpowered is an highly satisfying piece of work. Perhaps less interesting than Ruby Blue, but definitely amusing, entertaining and colorful, it reminds us how Moloko was driven by a potent creator. Refreshing !
Very good album! Great production , and some of the songs have the best beats of 2007 (like "Cry Baby"). She wants to innovate, and she does, but there are moment where she has to be more simple, she gets herself confused and makes us feel confused. But I admire for how she changed her music universe, beginning her solo career with a Nu Jazz/Electronic album, "Ruby Blue" (that was really great too); to an Electronic/Electro-pop/Dance/Pop album.
Roisin Murphy's second solo album is nothing short of a masterpiece. This is the kind of work that combines all the best "Roisin" you've ever heard - the amazing grooves of the best Moloko tunes (but in a totally original disco-meets-electronica-meets-blues-meets-new wave concoction) with Roisin's quirky solo style and a beautiful, sharp yet almost velvet-like clear voice. I have followed Roisin since the "do you like my tight sweater" days of the mid-90s and "Overpowered" makes you feel like this is what it's all been building up to. Nothing short of brilliant. It's difficult to pick favorite tracks, but "You know Me better"; "Primitive"; "Dear Miami"; "Cry Baby"; Scarlet Ribbons" and "Body Language" all deserve six shining stars. Finally "Tell Everybody"...deserves seven.... Buy. This. Album. Now.
Roisin's second album is a electronic and tribal masterpiece. Moving from electronic jazz to indie dance suited her quite nicely. It is refreshing to have a dance album that feels effortless. Download: Let Me Know, Movie Star, You Know Me Better.
the best album of Roisin Murphy in my opinión, sounds futuristic fun and emotional.
I Created Disco is a pretty good album but this is my least favorite album from him. There's really cool sounds that come out of this album but I like hearing him sing better than most noise. Best tracks in my opinion: Acceptable in the 80's, The Girls, I Created Disco
It was a time when Calvin was still a creative DJ. I won't say if it's better than Ready For The Weekend or not but it's definitely more risky than 18 Months and a lot less commercial than Motion. It was the beginning of a huge growth for Harris but I would prefer he keeps this style. The best songs from this album are: Neon Rocks, Vegas, Love For You and Love Souvenir.
It is a 10 out of 10.
Amazing album. For those of you looking for another "d-d-dont stup the beat", look elsewhere. Junior Senior's style changes with each song, and the result is an impressive blend of music that is consistent throughout the CD. A must-buy for anyone who calls themselves a fan of music, IMO. The lyrics are amazing, I cant tell you whether or not this is a concept album or not, but the songs definately have a story behind them, regardless of whether or not they all link together. And the bonus EP just seals the deal, this is an amazing package any way you look at it.
Wow. One of my favorite albums of 2005 finally gets released here. Well, it's about time. This album is one great pop song after another and a lot of fun.
Just pop blis. Everybody should get with this and DANCE!
Great party record. Solid and fun all the way. Make sure to get the version with the extra bonus ep!
Wow! This is so flamboyantly terrible. If you have the opportunity to remove Barney's sing along from your player, take the opportunity to listen to Junior Senior. While the beats are not bad, they certainly cater to a niche market of blind happiness and lyrical drivel.
the funky presidents are back on track
Verry good follow up to 2005's D-D-Don't Stop The Beat. Fans won't be deceived.
Vomit Skittles onto my checkered Vans. I'll reconsider if someone slips this all sly into a party's GangStarr/Eric B DJ set. Or a nice Stetsasonic mashup.
I was nearly crying when listening to the rubbishy Daft Punk's Human After All. Two years later, Justice's Cross made me smile again. There are no highlight here that can come up with Around the World or Digital love (although DVNO and Let there be Light aren't that far), but it's overall better : there's not a single weak track ! It's maybe not quite innovative, of course, but what it does, it does it very, very well. That deserves a 10 in my opinion.
Sometimes derivative, sometimes exceptionally original and forward thinking, but always pretty unique and different, and better and more consistent than most music out there. It's one of my favorite electronica albums of the decade, and I'm a fan of Four Tet, Junior Boys, DIzzie Rascal, The Streets, and Caribou.
Well... this caught me by suprise. Everyone compares this to Daft Punk, but -here's the shocker- it's not. Every song has it's own feel. The highlights of course are Genesis, D.A.N.C.E., Waters of Nazareth and my favorite, Stress. Every time I listen to each song, I notice new sound I never heard before. A masterful album, hats off to Justice, I'm still in awe.
Daft Punk wannabes. Absolute rubbish. I'd rather strum my pubes
It's official: D.A.N.C.E. is the catchiest song of the year. If only the rest of 'Cross' were as Daft Punk-ey...
After all, I don
I... just don't get it. I've heard some extraordinary dance music, and this is not consistently engaging. Too many songs just don't break (most notably D.A.N.C.E. and The Party) - they bop along at mid-tempo with vaguely irritating vocals. The interesting dark grungy energy of the first two songs tapers off quickly, reappearing only occasionally, and all you're left with is a Human After All remix - and that was a horrible, horrible album.
Cross shows the absolute power of GarageBand.Best Tracks: Genesis, Let There Be Light, D.A.N.C.E, Phantom, Phantom Pt. II, Valentine, Tthhee Ppaarrttyy, Stress, Waters of NazarethWorst Tracks: DVNO
Greatest debut since Daft Punk's 'Homework'. Killer from top to bottom.
Quite simply an amazing, pumping, electric album. Too bad only 3 songs have lyrics. Still, Waters of Nazerath and Newjack are sweet beats. Great album to buy.
Loud, analoguey, crunchy-nut dance music. For crunchy-nuts.
Entertaining. Insane. Loud. AMAZING.
do the dance witk your cousins from france - fkw.
Makes a nice pair with the Digitalism album, set to upset Kanye West for the second year running
Damn good bangin' stuff
This album transcends the line between headphones and dance floor in a way that only Justice can. Brilliant.
blinkin' good stuff for a debut album!
this is where rock n' roll went. find out or wander - i don't really care what happens to you.
I agree, amazing samples and rhythm.
Why do the French make the best (fun) dance music? I haven't been able to stop listening to this album since I brought it. It is no understatement when I say that this is one of the best dance albums this year. Much, MUCH better than 'From Here We Go Sublime'...
I have to disagree with some people.. D A N C E is almost cringeworthy, however - the rest of the album is top notch.
Reminds me of Jackson and his Computer Band Awesome...!
While we are all waiting for a REAL come back by Daft Punk, we can enjoy this great album by Justice. Standout tracks: "Let There Be Light", "Stress" and "Waters of Nazareth".
Even from a long time fan with just about every thing they've released - this album is incredibly surprising. Dynamic, musically complex and unpredictable and best of all, sounds nothing like their peers who do nothing but imitate them. True artistry and zeitgeist - this one will be remembered. (except maybe the song with the atrocious Uffie)
Electronica makes a comeback in 2007. The breaks and the grooves are both grimy and sexy, a provocative combo that will have your muscles twitching and your head spinning in all the right ways. Now start downloading it already.
Organic techno with pop-rock flavour! Surprisingly refreshing, ranks best electronic music album of the year, matching LCD SoundSystem's "Sound of Silver"
This isn't a pop album. This is a sublime musical experience.
At times, this album, like so many others have said, sounds like Daft Punk. But that shouldn't be a bad thing. Other times, it's a fairly original style of dance music with hard rock influences. There are so many incredible moments in this album, especially the song "Stress", which is a totally mind-blowing track fit for use in a horror movie or an emergency broadcast test. Aside from "Tthhee Ppaarrttyy", which is questionable, the album is totally solid, and a must have for dance fans. One of the finest releases of 2007, and certainly the best dance release.
Not a PERFECT record, but next to LCD Soundsystem's "Sounds of Silver," it's the best dance/electronic record of the year. The first bunch of tracks blow your mind, while others don't work quite as well. Still, it's a very solid album and should be liked by any fan of crazy electronic sounds with a dance beat.
When I first heard this record, I thought to myself sarcastically, "I wonder if the boys from Justice ever listened to any of the Daft Punk records." True, Justice sounds remarkably like the French house pioneers, but what the duo lacks in vision they make up for in a absolutely solid dance record. Organic and rock-ready, the record is worthy of most of the praise it has received (albeit a touch overrated).
The renaissance of dance is here! What better an album then Cross to put you in the mood to dance. And who better then this duo to put the romance back into of electronic. It's like finding a new boyfriend and he likes to d.a.n.c.e. to the b.e.a.t
Think the most beautiful album i got. it's always running on my hi fi at home,on my ipod, on my car, even if it was released one year ago!
An album with the ability to turn people from electro-haters to electro-lovers.
This is by far the best and most creative album of 2007. With both raw power and intense beats, this makes for a great play at a club, a superb album to listen to at home, and I would absolutely LOVE to see this in a film someday.
Best album of any genre last year (and this year, compared to the truckload of FAIL and AIDS that got dumped on the public this year).
Very fun. At first. After a while it gets VERY OLD, just like Daft Punk.
Like so many of these other 'user reviewers', my cd collection isn't chocabloc with many techno/house albums but I'm not going to compare every single new dance act I like to Daft Punk. I'm better than that. 'Cross' however is like a mix between the best bits of Idealism (don't Digitalism sound like Daft Punk?) and Mylo's Destroy Rock & Roll (which sounds like Discovery at times). Another album which will fit nicely into the "indie-nu-rave-sounds like Daft Punk" tastes of many of todays hippty hop kids. Not a bad thing...
Obviously inspired by Daft Punk's and other French producers' production style, this is a dance record dressed up in black and white striped shirts and tight jeans so that Indie kids needn't falter their image and admit they like dance music. Some amazing grinding beats and synths with a few irresistable hooks, but certainly not the revolutionary genre-busting album the blogs have been promoting. Unfortunately Justice's signature sound does not to well to round out an entire album of diverse material and multiple listens of this entire album may be an exercise in endurance once your adrenaline spikes levels off midway.
Will anyone ever stop comparing Justice to Daft Punk? They are two different acts with two different styles. The only thing they have in common is that they are French. Regardless, Cross is my favorite album of 2007, hands down.
One of the greatest Electronic albums in the last decade, Justice knows how make a dance album, and they do it well. Blaring hits such as "Waters of Nazareth" and "DVNO" are but a few among the truly epic songs on the album. My advice, "Go Buy This Album!"
Harder, Faster, Stronger than Daft will ever be, however I can see the simularities. This is the album you love at first listen and only gets better. Very Impressive.
While brief, this record is a great combination of dance beats and overdriving crunch with catchy melodies and Soulwax-like electronica tricks.
They´re not totally different to Daft Punk. They´re not building the reborn of dance music. They´re not getting back again the rave and disco culture. They´re sound a little bit original but not too much. They´re feeling to me overrated: oh, yeah.
Almost top of the class, not quite as good as daft punk but not far off. a sexy and fun album.
I've been waiting for a dance album this good for years. Not since Homework or Metro Area have I been so jaw-droppingly astounded by the quality of not only the production on the tracks, but the actual tunes themselves. The quality does drop slightly the further you progress through Cross, but it starts at such a high level that this is inevitable. If you love quality dance or electronica and you don't have this album, then stop reading this sentence and....
Very original tracks, one of the bests actual electronic albums, mix of dance, pop, rock and other alternative features makes this album unique and different, and that's very good.
It's one bass booming, riff jamming, beat dropping house album. Irreverently entertaining compared to Daft Punk, and will put thee under a spell that makes the feet move and one's head bobbing.
I don't really see why people keep comparing Justice to Daft Punk. They both totally have unique sounds. That being said, this album is, in my opinion, one of the best electronic albums of the last decade. I was getting tired of the endless flow of house music on the radio, and i almost thought that there was never going to be an artist as good as daft punk, patrick alavi or even deadmau5. That was before i discovered this album.It starts off with a dark, grungy sound on the epic opener ''genesis''. If you don't like this sound, you might as well just stop listening already. What comes afterwards is, in my opinion, sort of a roadblock. ''Let there be light'' starts with promising drums, but sticks to the simple four-chord melody for basically the rest of the song. Luckily, the good things keep going on afterwards, with the extremely catchy ''D.A.N.C.E'', the professionally sampled ''Newjack" and, the highlights of the album, ''Phantom'' and ''Phantom pt. 2''. These songs are the album in a nutshell: grungy, distorted, dark, but melodic at the same time. The 6 songs that come afterwards are awesome, good, or in the worst case, ''not that good''. They never completely disappoint though. The album ends with ''one minute to midnight'', which kind of sounds like rock music, just like ''stress''.If you are a fan of a dark, raw sound you might just love this album. If you like a lighter sound, just stick to the radio-house, for sake.Great songs: Genesis, D.A.N.C.E, Phantom, Phantom pt. 2, Stress, One minute to midnight.Less-great songs: Let there be light, Ttthhheee pppaaarrrtttyyy, DVNO
Justice stick out like a sore thumb when it comes to electro. They use all of the tried and true formulas to making a dance hit, yet it never, ever sounds uncreative or generic. This album is very distinct, as the use of a loud and gritty synth is used on nearly all the tracks (D.A.N.C.E being the only one without it) sometimes it is used in short stabs (Stress) and sometimes it is used as the lead of the track (Genesis, Phantom pt.1, Waters of Nazareth) This is great because now Justice have a very handy factor; a signature sound. The most Justice-y tracks (Waters of Nazareth, Phantom part 1 and 2, Genesis) are by far the best, with the vocal tracks DVNO and D.A.N.C.E. being radio and dancefloor friendly. (Save for Uffie's terrible contribution on Tthhee Ppaarrttyy which would have been better as an instrumental).
Pure Badassery.Justice were relatively kinda unheard of when they remixed a few songs including a Franz Ferdinand single. That too hardly gave away the ghost behind Cross's hallmarks. Nobody would've thought they'd combine components of punk and acid rock with disco quite like they ended up doing. For me the time at which this album was released was a perfect time for its release, and one thing's for sure - It sure has aged pretty gracefully - To me at least.
Best album of Justice by far, amazing flow and rhythm, every single song feels special in some way. The french always make the best electronic music d00ds.
A masterpiece. Supreme. This album definitely shows the greatness of french electronic music world. Innovation that only Justice or Daft Punk could bring to that era. The whole album gives an extremely good energy to the listener. One of the best albums in EDM.
Few bands manage to create such a derivative, powerful and aggressive ambience without getting everyone lost. The duo Justice struck really hard on their debut eponymous album. Far from being comparable to another famous french DJ duo (aka the Daft Punk) Justice stand out by their more abrasive, visceral and discordant upbeat tracks.Even if I can only recognize the presence of some fabulous switches and surprises characterising Justice's ballsy raw approach I also have to admit some tracks can easily give headache. 'Stress' couldn't bear a better title but is a perfect example of a track shining by the constancy of its hardcore style. Surprisingly I found that the songs with vocals on it were the most dreadful as 'DVNO' and 'The Party'.
CROSS is a dynamic, loud, and great album. DANCE is now very famous, and deservedly so. Stress and Phantom p.1 & p.2 are also high points.
Let's be real. Justice already proved themselves with the We Are Your Friends remix. This is their first studio debut and oh boy, is it a strong one. Must-have for all Justice fans out there. Genesis is the song which made me listen to whole discography of the French duo. Goddamn, I love France. Elegance, music and espionage.
Hilary really changed it up for this album. Songs like "Stranger" "With Love" Play With Fire" and "Between You and I" have Hilary's pop roots, but songs like "Gypsy Woman", "DIgnity" and " Burned" have a darker side of Hilary that no one's ever really seen. I applaud this album because Hilary sounds more original and less like the bubble gum pop artists of this generation
A vapid, meaningless, inherently superficial piece of Disney trash. The "music" is laughable, formulaic techno-dance pop bullshit. Yet another anorexic bimbo with a recording contract. And no, she does not write her own material. The worst kind of garbage imaginable.
Hilary continues showing his facet of overproduced artist showing null commercial importance, since it never got a success and nothing of this disc will be remembered in the posterity.
Best album in pop history, she paved the away for mainstream artists. "With Love" is a masterpiece that should have been #1 on every single chart around the world and dominate the lists but people are homophobic. Also this is her darkest album so give it up for Dignity you guys!
Difícil de acreditar que esse álbum lançado em 2007, parece que ele foi lançado no ano passado. A bíblia teen envelheceu como um vinho!
This album deserves more recognition. It's by far one of the best albums of 2007 and it's full of pop gems. Stranger, Gypsy Woman, Burned... There isnt a filler or bad song on this album.
big fan 's idea
This is basicly Hilary's best item up to date compare to all her previous attempt which might be all bubble-gum and sugar pop. This probably quite bubbly, but actually it's a totally nice attempt to alter her pop sound to electronic-pop. I can feel confidence in how she manage her music, but not on her voice; probably she's trying to hard to be poised and elegant. Her voice turned out weak. Dignity must be a HIT when she released her next single "Stranger". She should release "Gypsy Woman" as her 4th single, because it is the HOTTEST track on the album. This can be identified as Britney's TOXIC!!! Well, this song is Hilary's TOXIC "Gypsy Woman" I'd be waiting for your next album
This is the best hilary duff cd ever, although its not more rock than her last album, but its still amazing, for those of you who said she sucked, at least she worked hard and contributed so much time making a freakin album, imagine how long it takes to make ONE song.
It's meaningless and simply annoying. Duff doesn't depend on her own talent and tries to define herself as something else. Such a bad effort and a waste of time.
I think dignity is very good...maybe the best album of hilary duff...is very professional and cool,and the musics talk to me =) i wish u like too^^
i htink this is her best album to date, this shud be rated at least an a, for effort and result...the new genre she explored wors for her..but she needs to create much more catchier tunes so people would remember her..but i think "with love" has just done that for her...love hilary to the core
See Paris Hilton, circa 2006. P.S. Some of you idiots need a spell check.
Unbelievable, only one truly weak song (Between Me and You). And to "Nick C", she co-wrote all but one track on the album.
omg! this album is horrible! it's boring and lame. just when i thought she couldn't get worst she came out with this.
This CD is full of dancey and energetic tracks that it is almost impossible to sit still while listening to it. Overall, this CD calls for repeated playing at full blast!
This album is fantastic. Hilary's new sound is great and she is definately growing as an artist. She deserves to do well and this album really relects her hard work. The tracks are dancy and the lyrics and really meaningful.
She freakin' rox y'all sox off. You can't get no betta den Hilary Duff best belive dat Y'all. Houston Texas 4 Lyfe! Dignity eats up 2007 pop albums cept Best Damn Thing by Avril Lavigne which she is tied for. You go girlfriend
great album
When I bought Hilary Duff's new CD, "Dignity" I was expecting something new and improved, and that's what I got. Her upbeat tunes are fresh, and they are fun to sing to and dance to when you're feelin' blue. I really enjoy "Gypsy Woman", I've never heard Hilary sing something so fresh. Overall, I would have to say this is a great CD and a break from the rock tunes Hilary's been singing. I love all her CD's, and I can't wait until she comes out with a new one! Love it!
I can't believe I'm saying this - it's a step up! There is still some blandness, and some songs sound like rejects from Madonna's Confessions On A Dance Floor. But there are times in the middle of the CD where she does Gwen Stefani better than Gwen.
I've enjoyed Hilary Duff since her Lizzie McGuire days on Disney, and I snagged this CD from my little sister. I was shocked at what a great pop album it turned out to be, and I anticipate that this will become part of the soundtrack to my summer. Sure, it's derivative. But she stole from all the right people.
i love this album!!! there is onlt one song that i don't like, but other than that it is amazing!!!!!
is this what u ppl call good music?
great albem
Hilary Duff is back and better then ever! All the songs are creative and unique, funky sounds and outstanding vocals. Her best work yet! Well done Hilary!
it's really hot!!!
I love this album! It's like her best one so far! Half of these critics don't know what they're saying about it being bad. Keep up the AWESOME work, Hilary!!
this is one of the best cd i've ever listen to, she's the best
Wow! I didn't like hilary duff much, first... but I tried to give dignity a listen.. and it was suprisingly very good! every song is good, except no work, all play. that one is boring
i love this album.....very catchy and lot more different than her previous albums
Amazing...Full heart and Soul in this album!!!
I was never really been a big fan of Hilary but I have to say that this CD is not bad at all. Most of the songs are quite catchy and have a decent beat. I think that this is CD is a good step in the right direction for Hilary. There is definitely a more mature sound to the lyrics and music and is in no way similar to her previous "teeny-bopper" records at all. Absolutely worth a listen!
I am a little impressed although I have been a Hilary fan forever... this cd has some good songs others.. are just unfortunatly horrible. Anyways good luck on a new album if you are thinking of it Hil! PS: my fave is Gypsy Woman
i love it, Hillary is awesome
I love hilary duff, very good album.
A strong third time out from Hilary, she is showing that she can have adult sensibilities while retaining a level of class. However a few of the tracks on this album come off mundane and in some cases it feels like she is trying too hard to escape the musical image her ex helped her form.
This Cd is just so good. She is finally trying to find her own sound instead of copying someone else's sound. Keep up the good work Hilary!!!!!
the best of her i loved it
The best album ever !! Hilary have done a great work !! She rocks !!
This is the best album of the year !!! buy it !!!
this is so her best album yeet. i loved it!
It is a GREAT album, i listen to it so much, all the songs are so catchy, i recommend everyone and anyone to buy it! its awsome
I love you hilary!!! Your songs are the best I've ever heard!
A overrated album by far, does not deserve a 61 on metacritic. Why? Production is outdated, no catchy pop tunes, and hilary duff has abandoned her teen pop roots for dance pop. The problem, She's not edgy enough to pull off dance music and the production isn't even good for a club record. Disappointing... and by the way her lyrics really suck. An immature release from a confused individual.
Hil's new CD was dissapointing, especially because one of her previous albums, Metamorphosis, was so good and a huge hit. I am still a big fan of hers, but I wish that she will do better in her next CD.
I could go down on her for days.
Not cool. Not good either.
Instead of croons and ridiculous teen-pop-dance trash, our little Lizzie dissed the cheese and matured into a real pop star... which makes Dignity such a gem in coming-of-age pop she once shortly conquered.
Fortunately for Duff, Dignity is glossily produced and musically and lyrically more clever than her previously Lavigne-esque albums. But unfortunately for Duff's weak vocals layered under the most generic dance beats, synths, and indie rock guitars, it ultimately results in an overall mature, but ineffective pop album. Its standout tracks, "Stranger", "With Love", and "Gypsy Woman", incorporate the album's finest dance-pop influences with Duff's appropriately girl-powered lyrics. However, its weaker tracks, such as the album's title track "Dignity" and lead single "Play With Fire", fall between the lines of average and mediocre.
This album is a indeed a masterpiece. Every track in this is **** good. 61 out of 100? Isn't even fair. These critics should go listen to it again. Dignity is their best album and I'm sure of that.
Well i like it, most of it but, i think her previous albums were better in general i don`t know, its nice that she started write her songs, but i think she should not do it, better leave it to other writers
Before electropop was popular, before gaga even exist, this album has been the electopop jam. Perfection from start to finish. Gypsy Woman, along with Burned, With Love, and Stranger are the highlight of the album.
For Hilary, "Dignity" was what "Can’t Be Tamed" was for Miley, "Revival" for Selena or "Dangerous Woman" for Ariana. She was breaking free from her teen bubblegum Disney image. She was 19 at the time the album was released. Unlike Miley or Ariana, growing up didn’t mean shocking, sexual lyrics or walking around naked for Hilary but personal lyrics and a mature sound and image (including a new hair color).With "Dignity", Hilary moved away from the bubblegum pop of her debut "Metamorphosis" or the teen pop-rock from her self-titled second album. The album was a dance pop and electro-pop album with influences from genres like R&B, hip-hop and rock music and some oriental sounds here and there. She had never been so involved in an album. She served as the executive producer and co-wrote 13 of the 14 tracks on the album. The album is her most personal to date as it addresses topics such as her breakup from her then boyfriend, her stalker, fame, fake people in Hollywood, the divorce from her parents after 22 years and her fathers' unfaithfulness which caused it. All those pretty serious topics were wrapped in a danceable dance pop sound. To me this is Hilary‘s most experimental and personal work to date and her second best album after "Breathe In. Breathe Out", the album that followed 8 years later. It is definitely her most cohesive album though and is criminally underrated.Favorites: Happy, Gypsy Woman, Stranger, Play With Fire & Outside of You
Dignity de Duff y Blackout de Spears son y seguirán siendo albumes adelantados a su época y muy infravalorados, ambos merecían más reconocimiento tanto comercial como en crítica.
This is one of the best albums I've ever listened to. The lyrics are soo good. I love this.
Hilary em um dos seus melhores momentos!! Um álbum intenso, sexy, provocante, divertido e sedutor.
Just really bad
Hugely disappointing. The lyrics are a mess and the music repetitive. Not worth the hype and no indication of "nu rave" what-so-ever. Get out there and buy The Arcade Fire or Arctic Monkeys and leave trollop like this on the shelf.
Have liked the Klaxons for a while now, and downloaded the four dozen songs off their myspace site. The hype has grown, and the album was never going to meet theype - but it's very good. Those who were hoping for ten versions of Golden Skans will be disappointed, but those who like their 'Atlantis To Interzone' side as well will find it rewarding.
New Rave its only to sell cds!! Its not original but have some good songs!!
Hype aside, this is a killer album. 'Myths' sounds like nothing else out there and althoughit may not work for some, I just can't get enough.
Hits some real highs, however, not the best album to listen to all the way through. This band does have a amazing live show though
No matter how many times i repeat Myths... it never manages to reach the expectations that the likes of 'Atlantis To Interzone' and 'Gravity's Rainbow' set before it.
Great album best thing I have heard in along time
A breath of fresh air, possibly, but it's one foul breath. An increasingly grating and boring listen, just gets irritating when you realise the whole thing's made up of one 'Golden Skans' and ten semi-decent filler tracks.
Fantastic, frenetic indie-electro-pop! Klaxons are good, by no means great, but they've got enough identity stamped all over the tracks on this album to make this record something unique. The songs are diverse enough to keep the album interesting. The energy and urgency are present in all songs, and the electronica emplyed here is done with a great degree of style. There are only 2 poor tracks on the album, and i've only knocked off one mark because the rest of the album makes up for it. Its an exciting record, and can be listened to as a collection of indie songs or as beating, bleeping dancefloor fodder. Ace!
Pathetic rubbish, Guardian review is spot on.
Disjointed and overally diappointing...well, not worthy of all the hype leading up to it. There are some "stand out singles", a adequate description for an album that has just a few good songs.
im his dad his band are amazing :-) then i would say that wouldnt i serious heis band is seriously great
What are the lyrics on about? Apart from that, this album leaves a lot to be desired. The tunes are good, but every song is the same. I got bored of it VERY quickly.
Horrible. A huge disapointment, makes me lose faith in the direction music might be going.
I was surprised by how catchy this album is. I couldn't not stop listening to it for the past 6 months or whenever it first came out! Bloody briilliant and awesome live too! (Although crowd is a bit young, but hey it's still as fun...)
Several great tracks like 'Atlantis to Interzone' or 'Gravity's Rainbow', but ultimately horribly over-hyped. And actually quite boring.
For me, it's the graetest album out for earley 2007. Just a fun listen!!!
The best thing I can say about this album is that's it's "ok"
A nice and melodic disc that is made up of schizophrenic vocals (that are really beautiful) and nice/upbeat electro-rock. Think the Beach Boys meet New Order and you have it!
FantasticK!
Personally, I'm really enjoying this album. Very fun to listen to. For it's genre, I feel it's in the upper end compared to many other similar bands. The music gets you up, moving and dancing and after all, isn't that all that matters in the end? Who cares if it's the same chord progressions over and over, music shoud not be over-analyzed. Simply, enjoyed.
One of the best this year.
Soaring through space and time to a land of glow sticks and neons. The Klaxons have arrived
two or three ok songs, then those monotonous, repetitive sing-songy chord structures, over and over and over again I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown - aaaaahhhh! "glow sticks"? "neon" what is this? have you people ever heard real rave music (it was 90% horrible too!) this is just fashion music. clangy and irritating after track four but yeah, first few tracks ok. mercury prize!?!? nuts.
I love it, a breath of fresh air to all the latest indie bands
Nice surprise! Very string and innovative...
The rave scene. When you think about it, you would associate it with house music and drum 'n' bass. The kind of music you'd hear blaring out of many 17 year-old adolescents' cars on a main road in a not very well known town. And then something weird happened. Rave got indie. New and young bands emerged and took indie music to the clubs. There were many pioneers of this. Late Of The Pier, for example, or Crystal Castles with their 8-bit chips at the ready. But there was no pioneer as distinctive, popular or insane as Klaxons.Now with less experienced indie-rave bands, they will make an album which will sound pretty strange and almost chaotic, but at the same time make an album that fails to capture their live sound. So all of the pressure was on Klaxons to make a pretty damn good album. And did they do it?Well 'Myths Of The Near Future' starts with 'Two Receivers', which starts with a quiet build-up of drums that then leads to a massive chorus, with indie guitars, rave synthesizers, and HUGE bass. Following it is 'Atlantis To Interzone', which is a primary example of Klaxons can do when they go absolutely mental. It's also the best ever use of a school Yamaha DJ keyboard. The clubs love it. The indie fans love it. And I love it.Then comes the song Klaxons are probably famous for, 'Golden Skans'. It's one of the most simple moments here, but still satisfies the ravers in great style. 'Totem On The Timeline' is a frantic 3-minute frenzy that's lyrics speak of meeting various historical figures in Club 1830. I.e. it's great.So too is 'As Above So Below', slower than some songs on here, but still keeps the wild party alive. Mind you, it would do, because it has a chorus the size of the cosmos it speaks of. 'Isle Of Her' is the slowest song on the album (and longest, if you don't count the 17-minute silence at the end of 'Four Horsemen Of 2012', which I'll talk about later). But is it boring? Hell no. It's as weird as the rest of the album, singing "Cyclops gazing alone", but is strangely chilling, something which Klaxons do very well indeed.The pace picks up with the arrival of single 'Gravity's Rainbow'. It's only two-and-a-half minutes, but it fills those two-and-a-half minutes with some of the most chaotic, insane and brilliant indie music that has been gracing the whole of Klaxons' debut. 'Forgotten Works' recalls J.G Ballard's short story book, which is also called 'Myths Of The Near Future', hence the album title. But the references are surrounded in a sound that dominates the three-and-a-half minutes. It is fantastic.Then comes what is definitely the pinnacle of the album, 'Magick'. Lesson to new bands: blaring synthesizers, pummeling drums and chilling vocals makes up for one hell of a song. Take heed, songwriters. Then comes a cover of the 90s dance made famous by Grace, 'Not Over Yet', which is a song I don't like. But if you listen to the cover version, you'll be able to tell that Klaxons have transformed it into something it should have been originally - mind-blowing.It all finishes with the afore mentioned 'Four Horsemen Of 2012', which, if not for the 17-minute silence following it, would be the shortest song on the album. The song itself is the noisiest and the scariest, but is incredibly thrilling at the same time.To sum up, then, 'Myths Of The Near Future' is regularly cacophonous, often insane and sometimes terrifying. Which is everything an indie-rave album should be.DOWNLOAD: 'Two Recievers', 'Forgotten Works', 'Magick'
It's got an absolutely blistering cover of "It's Not Over Yet" and you see absolute genius in action here. Outside of that there isn't much else that grabs my attention. Yes its experimental and tried lots of new ideas out but generally it reminds me of a poorer, much less focused and much less melodic version of Bloc Party.
This makes me dance! Cant wait to see them live later this month.
Just superb! i eagerly awaited this album and my expectations were surpassed... nic offers (intended) a range not offered before... the music is obviously sensational and thankfully they have managed to maintan the length to their tunes - which i'm sure their adoring fans appreciate - !!! take you for a ride and inevitably the album becomes a loop one just cant stop - brilliant production too...there are samples reminiscent of the avalanches to take the final seconds of a track into a quiet spiral, guitar licks reveberating raw, basslines that take you back to the cure, and a drum beat that shatters leftism and some - this is edgy and a thirst quencher - standout tracks are "Must be the Moon", "A New Name" and "Break in Case of Anything" (great to hear the out hud girls on that one)... well done lads and cant wait to see them live!!!
Superb album! I have trouble getting into the song "Sweet Life" (triggers unfortunate memories of Sublime at times), but other than that, there's not a loser in the bunch. A very pleasent surprise to jumpstart 2007.
Kill the lyrics and you may have something. It seems like they've moved "forward" in an attempt to improve their songwriting but in doing so have ended up sounding like everything else. Bring back the long jams!
Frenetic and artsy in a field of recent frenetic, artsy albums; (Of Montreal, Panda Bear, -insert recent indie album here-) at the very least, you can dance to it. !!! got me grooving a little more than the others with their darker sound and vocals that, while they tend to be, well, "chanty," brought back memories of Shriekback. In a good away.
Great ´n funky
These songs should get some asses shaking when they play them live.
Yes!Yes!Yes! Very good album. When u think u have the music sussed they throw in some surprises. Heart of Hearts, New Name and Break in Case of Anything are standout tracks, tho their stint supporting the Chillis have influenced Sweet Life mibbees?
I hate comparing bands, but this time it's unavoidable. !!! and Of Montreal, both indy dance rock bands, have new cd's out, and Of Montreal is easily better. I just didn't have fun with this one. It wasn't bad, but they try way too hard, and I just can't bring myself to have repeat listens. If I ever hear it playing, I might just dash to the dance floor, but don't expect to hear it blasting from my stereo or car.
Good and different
Funky as hell. Great stuff.
It's alright, but I think their drum machine's broken- their songs are all the same tempo
Disappointing. Bad lyrics. Boring.
Irresistible grooves and a more balanced attack make Myth Takes the best !!! album to date. While it may not reach the heights of songs such as "Me And Giuliani Down by the School Yard" or "Pardon My Freedom", Myth Takes is consistently good to great. "Must Be the Moon" has the funkiest outro in ages. Their live show is not to be missed.
I cant stop listening to this album... its just that wonderful!
perfect!!!
Myth Takes is a strange wonderful art album. It blends psychedelic rock with dance-rock so perfectly well together. The stand out track is easily "Must Be The Moon". Each track sounds more different than the one before it. All In All, Chk Chk Chk have crafted a strange album that blends psychedelic and punk rock perfectly. B+
Funky album. Myth Takes, All My Heroes Are Weirdos, Must Be the Moon, Heart of Hearts, Yadnus, and Bend Over Beethoven were excellent songs. deserves to be big.
In a world with no jazz, this would be the American Jamiroquai (or any other good band from the acid jazz movement in the early 90s).Drawing influences from rock, pop, general alternative and electronic music, but always sounding as **** as hell.Memorable album by a great band - probably their best.
best songs: early winter, 4 in the morning, wonderful life and the sweet escape. worst song: breakin' up.
People don’t know anything, this album is great and she sounds better than some other pop trashy female artists out there, she’s between Madonna and Kylie Minogue...
This album actually isn't a particularly "bad" album. It just has some major flaws. Highlight tracks: "Early Winter", "Sweet Escape", "4 in the Morning", "Wonderful Life", "Now That You Got It."
Wow..a lot of people saying Gwen should go back to No Doubt. Well I personally think that No Doubt suck and Gwen should stick to her far more interesting solo work - this album is pretty good.
I enjoyed it a lot. True there are some *weird and horrible* songs but i love... Wind It Up Orange County Girl Yummy Don't Get it Twisted
i gave it a four....because thats how many songs on this album are any good.....the rest are abismal at best.....it fell WAY short of LAMB
I Absolutely LOVE Gwen's New Album. All the songs are wickedly infectious! The tunes are catchy and upbeat. I know "The Sweet Escape" ft Akon will hit the top charts next. I love Pharrell's work too. She's got the LAMB and he's rocking the Ice Cream blend it together they got something fresh and kinda in between.
Other than the sweet escape, this CD is horrible. GWEN GET BACK WITH NO DOUBT!!!
I absolutely loved this album, personally I like it better than the first one which is saying alot. I find it intresting that so many people are calling her a "wigger" when the whole album is much more pop based than hip-hop. You should listen to it in it's entirety more than once and I promise you won't be disappointed.
I like most of it. I like the music and beat of breaking up but it is too monotonous for me fast becomes annoying. stand out tracks in my opinion: sweet escape, 4 in the morning, yummy. Wind it up would have been better with more mature lyrics and less rap. worst songs: dont get it twisted and orange county girl. Still, I have listend to the whole album a million times already.
There's only only one White Female Rapper that pulled it off correctly. Anyone remember Tarrie B? Gwen's debacle on Wind it up was the most treacherous thing I've heard since I heard Milli Vanilli try and talk. Gwen needs to grow-up and go back to No Noubt and make some REAL music. Stop the Pop and go back to your roots... please!
This album is completely amazing. Almost all the tacks are instantly memorable and catchy...and doesn't that make for a great album?? I hate these little comments about Gwen trying to catch up to Fergie....excuse me if I'm wrong but Fergie's "London Bridge" sounds like Hollaback girl with a little more melody...and Fergie's "Glamorous" sounds an awful lot like gwen's "Luxurious"...if anything..Fergie's a few years behind..though both album are very good....Gwen's sound isn't for the older type of listeners..which seem to be the professional critics rating her
A triumph. Yes, some of its songs are a tad sappy, but every one (besides the wretched "Breakin' Up, but I'll ignore that) is a pleasure to listen to. "Wind It Up," "Don't Get It Twisted," and "Yummy" are among the most fun and the funniest songs of Gwen's career, and "The Sweet Escape" is positively brilliant. On the whole, a spectacular album.
Throw one more on the pile of treasonous, unlistenable garbage from Gwen Stefani's recent years. Once one of the most compelling female figures in all of mainstream music, Gwen seems to be doing all she can to bury her personality under a thick coat of gloss and thumping beats. Wheras her voice once spoke of both power and pathos, it now falls flat on track after track, lifeless and soulless. Did Gwen homogenize herself willingly, or is she yet another victim of bad decisionmaking by her record label? Either way, on Sweet Escape, Stefani is even less than a shadow of her former self. She's a shadow of every other cloying, disposable female booty-shaker out there.
This album is 1000 times better than L.A.M.B., though the first single "wind it up" is a horrible song.. the rest of the album has amazing songs, such as Wonderful LIfe with Depecho mode,, or Early Winter with Keane... go and get it...
This Album is something speacial, this breaks into her R&B side. Gwen did an awesome job. Sounds to me like the Hills still have music! ha!
'the sweet escape' wins this year's 'worst comeback album' - gwen's half-assed attempt on her second solo album gives listeners the impression that she just doesn't care anymore, and her confidence in the album's success doesn't help either (in one of the song's lyrics, saying she'll get a grammy...pfft - as if). half the album makes you want to spew, tracks such as 'orange county girl', 'yummy' and the most tragic song you've ever heard, 'breaking up', in which gwen repeats every line about 5 times each. 'breaking up' reeks of a washed up singers career - i'm sorry gwen, but it looks like 'the sweet escape' listeners of the album will be wanting is your retirement...give it up
I love gwen, but this album has no edge. It sounds like everything on the radio.
It has its hits, and its misses. But all in all, it's a pretty decent album. Most of the best tracks are in the ballads, like "Early Winter". Some of the powerpop songs seem a bit forced and recycled.
great album.. lamb was better but... gwen is awesome
I really wish she'd get off of her solo aspirations, because honestly without the aid of her band, producers don't know what the hell real music is. And if I hear Wind It Up one more time, I'm going to snap.
IF you haven bought this album i do recomend it. If you Havent listen to the album and only listend to the single wind it up. i recomend that you hear the single The Sweet Escape featuring Akon. i have heard that the single Wind it up wasnt a big big hit but it was good. Just beacuse u didnt like the first single that doesnt mean that the album is annoying
it waz real gd!
This album isnt as good as the first solo album from gwen, i mean, it could have been better, muchh better
I never bought this cd with the intention of hearing highly sophisticated lyrics, all i really expected was some catchy tunes, much like her first solo, which i thought was amazing. however this cd mostly had lame beats, and lyrics that were so horrible that at some points it made me cringe. sorry gwen, but ya shoulda stuck with just one solo like ya said ya would.
Excellent Album.Though it is not as good as the previous Gwen Stefani's previous album,But our of the 13 songs,i liked 9 of them.Excellent album.
Really well done with catchy beats. But still not the best album of the world.
I Rated Each Song: Wind it up - 8/10 The Sweet Escape- 9/10 Orange County Girl - 6/10 Early Winter - 6/10 Now That you Got It - 7/10 4 in the morning - 10/10 Yummy - 9/10 Fluorescent - 7/10 Breakin' Up - 7/10 Don't Get It Twisted - 6/10 U Started it - 6/10 Wonderful Life - 8/10
Lackluster effort from Mrs. Stefani. Sounds rushed with no evident hits.
This album is so catchy i loved it although there are some songs that i wasnt particularly fond of they all were sweet i hope she keeps making more cds like this their all so catchy and u cant stop singing them.
I would really like to hear that she just threw this together. The idea that she spent time working on this album seem wasteful. No doubt she should return to No Doubt.
What happened here? I was a big fan of Gwen in No Doubt, as well as her first solo album "L.A.M.B." "The Sweet Escape" is a different story; everything from the uneven production, awful lyrics and oddly pitch corrected vocals make this escape anything but sweet. Half of the album sounds finished and somewhat fresh ("Early Winter", "The Sweet Escape"), and the other half is perplexingly awful ("Breaking Up", "Now That You Got It", "Orange County Girl"). Gwen seems to be under the impression that every hip-hop-esque song she does has to follow the blueprint of Hollaback Girl with chanty, military drill like choruses ("Now That You Got It", "Breaking Up", "Wind It Up" all suffer from this) or have to involve Gwen talking about how great but down to earth she is. This is the sound of Gwen stepping into cringe-worthy Jenny From The Block territory. The pop structured songs work better, but Gwen's voice sounds extremely pitch corrected on the album highlight "Early Winter", as well as "Flouresant". Wha't's hard to ignore is the traces of Peaches, with all the "talk-singing" Gwen does and Kelis ("Yummy" has the exact same beat as "Milkshake") just to name a few of familiar vibes on the album. Either way, this album is a mess, a misguided and decidedly unhip mix of hip-hop and pop, with flat song structures and production.
The Sweet Escape is great. Its highs may not be as high as those on L.A.M.B. but it doesn't have as many low points as that album did. Pharrell's productions on The Sweet Escape are overshadowed by songs by Swizz Beatz, Akon, Nellee Hooper and Tony Kanal. Overall, it's a mindless fun CD.
there is nothing listenable on this album. pharrell can't save this.
L.A.M.B. was better, but the more you listen to Sweet Escape the more you're gonna appreciate it. Song 12 Wonderfull Life is wonderfull and Song 4 Early Winter is one of the best songs by Gwen.
Gwen, darling, while I no doubt love your band, this second solo album is a hint that you have some serious inclinations toward jumping a shark tank in your near future. I mean, look at the cover photograph. Who are you trying to emulate, a female Moby? You sure don't look like Madonna, who tried - in vain - to cop some of Marilyn's heat. But at least Madonna has a set of cajones; I mean, anyone who walks down an interstate au natural is either crazy or has thicker skin than the rest of us, and also wants us to see it. This offering seems to indicate that you're running out of ideas and you're just going for weird to buy time. Are you looking for a sweet escape from the terribly boring life of the garden variety rock star, or is this your pathetic plea for help?
almost as much fun as the first album! cheers to Gwen...what a funky peice of hot ass she is! :)
Wow!! Gwen has done it again. She has made another decent fully-listeneable album, which is also an album which you don't feel like skipping a single track... thats a rareity these days. Love every moment of "The Sweet Escape". standout tracks = "4 In the Morning", "Yummy", "Now That You Got It", "Breakin' Up". What a delight it is to see Ms. Stefani back at it!!
It's no L.A.M.B - but it is still a respectable album - and Fergie needs to back off on the cloning of Gwen- keep it up- and bring back No Doubt!
It is a great fun follow-up .... Gwen rules
This album is great, it has great songs and it can do no wrong. There's an 80's dance vibe on some songs but she does it well
Most of the songs in "The Sweet Escape" are GREAT. I mean, just great! You can find so many diversity, like the crazy beats in "Wind It Up" and "Yummy", the circus theme in "Don't Get It Twisted", the reggaeton-ish "Breakin' Up", and the CLASSIC ballads (which are the best thing off the album), "4 In The Morning" and "Early Winter". The problem is (and that's why Im not giving a 10 to the album), is that all the songs together in 1 album are not quite interesting. It's sort of like they were rushed and picked up randomly. Except for that, the songs are amazing! Even though I can't wait for Gwen to return to No Doubt, which should be soon!
I enjoyed it very much. The track "The Sweet Escape" is brilliant..I also love Yummy. It's a lot of fun. Gwen brings interesting music.
I love Gwen, but this album is a piece of crap. Ony 'the Sweet escape' and 'Early winter' are good, rest are not worth to listen.
this album is for fans only. and not necessarily fans of gwen's music, because we all are, but fans of gwen. people who may be perfectly content to sit around and think about gwen for the entire duration of the album. it's full of her personality but lacks the musical discipline that shot her to the top.
This CD is going in the garbage
Just isn't on par with the genuis of No Doubt. Fun for a day, gets old quick. Gwen is so forgettable.
I think it is really good music, perhaps not a deep album, but it works well, here my review of every song: 1. Wind It Up.- Fun, upbeat, neptunes-production 7/10 2. The Sweet Escape.- Damn! What a great tune. Reminds me the old Gwen 10/10 3. Orange County Girl.- Love the beat 8/10 4. Early Winter.- Nice down-tempo, coulda sound better 7/10 5. Now That You Got It.- Mmmm I didn't like this song, but it's pretty catchy 6/10 6. 4 In The Morning.- What can i say?? Just a piece of art 10/10 7. Yummy.- I can almost be sure this would be a single, it's a great tune, like it was Hollaback Girl 4 L.A.M.B. 9/10 8. Fluourescent.- At first I skip this song but then it just start to grew up on me and now I really like it 8/10 9. Breakin' Up.- Nice beat, bad lyrics, too boring 5/10 10. Don't Get It Twisted.- Another outstanding song, I just can't get sick of this 10/10 11. U Started It.- Cool but something's missing 7/10 12. Wonderful Life.- The only left-over of L.A.M.B., enjoyable 8/10 Avarage: 7.9
First and last tracks take a chance. (I personally love the step off into The Sound of Music.Fun. Who cares if no one else gets that?! Hope their Lederhosen chafe them.) But dear Gwen, you coulda waited a while to holla back if this is all you had to offer. I have faith that you'll climb your next musical mountain and kick ass again. love to you--you talented amazing young woman.
WOW! amazing CD!
This was a great album Gwen Did Great Job!
I think it is a good CD. The quality and sound of her music is great and I think she gets an 8.
This album is not half as bad as some say, but L.A.M.B. was a far higher quality album than this. For overall strength this one was pretty weak; some good songs, some bad. But Gwen has conceded to the 'trends' and 'raps' way too much instead of singing, which she does best. And ironically enough, the best track would have to be 'The Sweet Escape'. This is what pop should be, clean and simple. Other than that other good tracks would be Early Winter (9/10; emotional and a decent follow up to Cool, although not as good), Fluorescent (9/10; very well put together and catchy/retro), 'Wind It Up' (7.5/10; a little weird, but it's decent listen), Yummy (9/10; catchy and fun song lyrically), and Wonderful Life (9/10). But really there are some shockers on this album, like 'Orange County Girl' (3/10; horrible production values, and truly annoying), 'Now That You Got It' (4/10; not in Gwen's style at all and doesn't suit her), 'Breakin' Up' (1/10; this song is awful. Spare yourself and skip it). And the rest just aren't very strong, '4 in the Morning' (7/10; too sappy), 'Don't Get it Twisted' (5.5/10; an attempt to be quirky), and 'U Started It' (6/10; OK but nothing great). So with only five of the tracks being strong enough to comprise of a decent album, I'd only be able to say 'OK'. The others are just average or downright awful.
love this so much!!
More of a mix bag then anything, but it's a mix bag where everything is awesome. I love the different styles and stuff she's used, totally unique album
if you liked L.A.M.B then you will like this one not as much but it's still good though.
Excellent stuff that grows on you with more listens. It's not better than L.A.M.B but it's just as good. More cohesive, just as crazy as before, but maybe less diverse. I love the futuristic and modern feel to the music. No bad tracks here too.
another brick in the wall
Great CD, Got some great tracks, some good tracks and some really interesting ones. The melodies and hooks will have you back for more, and upon repeated listens the good tracks and interesting ones get better. Excellent "straight-thru" CD
oh what has happened to gwen..........i would of liked to be there when she told no doubt that she was leaving the band to pursue a carear in crap hop music.
For the most part a great album, make no mistake, it's no L.A.M.B. From the lead "Wind It up" to the title track, and "Yummy" a dance track produced by Pharrell, and in my opinion the best song on the album is the final track "Wonderful Life" in lieu of a "The Real Thing"-esque light dance track. From its highest points, I beleive that "Breakin' up" was the worst excuse for music Stefani has ever produced simulating a fake cell-phone conversation. All in all, if you're a die-hard fan, as am I, it is a great choice, otherwise, you may not like it, but it's worth a shot.
horrible, produces a continous flow of drivel
i love her almost as much as i love gary. i love to dress like her and sing to her music and she is really popuular at the gay bar i go to its called the dirty sattle i love her
4 good song. 1 point for each: 1. wonderful life 2. early winter 3. the sweet escape 4. 4 in the morning
There are a few clunkers... but the tracks Wonderful Life, Early Winter, Flourescent, and The Sweet Escape abolish any bad feelings I have toward the other songs.
A confusing album, at first listen i was not sure whether i liked it or hated it. The whole album is a mess and lacks focus, but at the same time; it is what makes gwen unique and refreshing to listen to. However, I will have to say that this album does suffer from the lack of a consistent musical genre that gwen has still not chosen. She's at her best when she goes new wave pop. The album is a hit and miss throughout. The album has a weird complexity to it that requires repeated listenings. Overall, there is a depth in gwen's new album that is not often found in major pop releases, but at the same time; the album is not instantly catchy and is off the wall weird on some songs.
YUMMY!
Save your money! I just bought this album and was very dissapointed. I could go on but it sucked the enrgy right out of me. Sorry Gwen
THE SWEET ESCAPE, Gwen Stefani's follow-up to her multiplatinum debut solo album L.A.M.B. is point blank another perfect guilty pleasure candidate. To start off, you have to have a fondness for Gwen's quirky Debbie Harry-esque lyrical indulgences and genre-switching tendencies to really appreciate this album. Without it, the majority of THE SWEET ESCAPE will just get on your nerves. That said, it's Gwen's personality that carries songs such as hit "Wind It Up", "Orange County Girl" and "Breakin' Up". If they had been recorded by someone else (such as Fergie) the songs would have been unbearable; "Wind It Up" for example is eventually infectious and grows on you with it's Sound of Music sampling, but there are parts of the song that still remain horrid after you've learned to like it, and it's only my soft spot for Gwen that made me give the song more than one chance. Not surprisingly it's her collaborations with frequent No Doubt producer Nellee Hooper that provide the album's best tracks. "Wonderful Life" is wonderful indeed, and the gorgeous ballad "Early Winter" is a nearly genius song. THE SWEET ESCAPE has a different vibe from L.A.M.B. and is unfortunately less fun as well, but that doesn't mean it's not fun at all. The thing that bugs me the most when discussing these solo projects is people saying how much better her work with No Doubt was, how she "sold out" and went pop. While her lyrical contributions to No Doubt were of a better quality most of the time, songs such as "Makin' Out" from 2001's much overrated ROCK STEADY are just as dumb and frivolous as anything off of L.A.M.B. and THE SWEET ESCAPE. It's not like Gwen was in a band like Hole and then suddenly decided to usurp Madonna's crown. There was always this poppy side to her waiting to fully explode. What many people fail to realize is that these albums are about having fun with a musical project, not about making artistic statements-Gwen was never trying to make VESPERTINE. At 47 minutes THE SWEET ESCAPE is a breezy listen. If you let it, it just might carry you away with it's sweet oddity.
ohh yess
Didn't expect anything good from an album lead by a "lady sovereign'esque pop grime beat meets yodel"-single like "Wind It Up", and boy, how right I was. This album is a frankenstein made of pop-cultural remains, just like Ms. Stefani herself.
best pop album of 2007
This album is so annoying! and so is Gwen Stefani.
Are your folks serious? Gwen was cool when she emulated Bjork. She was ok when she looked on Madonna for inspiration. Now on this record, she sounds like a cheap desperate wannabee hiphop ho who can neither rap nor sing.
Nothing new...same ole...all of the wigga girls in the industry can sing each other's bubble gum stuff and you wouldn't miss a thing. You're 39, not 19.
"Early winter" is an absolute beaute of a song - best track on the album. "Wonderful life", "4 in the morning" and "U started it" are good poptunes as well. She got lucky with "Wind it up", "The sweet escape" and "Now that U got it". The rest we have already heard... Gwen, a word of advice: get rid of The Neptunes and look for new talent.
Gwen didn't seem to know the difference between wonderfully wacky and totally annoying. This album is awful.
i dont understand d critics... n evn allmusicguide gave less den 80 when diz record shud be 100!! i agree wit Valterri, "early winter" is a masterpiece... an emotional number, too... wind it up is an ingenious production and the sampling of "the sound of music" is a hell of an idea -in a good way-! this rocks even better than LAMB!
I Like This Album Alot! I Do Feel Like A Few Of The Songs Felt Rushed Which Effected This Album With Critic's And Fans.. But I Really Enjoyed It Alot! Gwen If Fore Sure Not Going Down Hill!
The songs that are best are The Sweet escape , Early winter , 4 in the morning , Don't get it twisted and Wonderful life The other songs are ok and good but the worst song is breaking up which is totally stupid but ignore that its a good album :)
Just A Great Classic Album!
I love it! With songs like "Orange County Girl", "Don't Get It Twisted", and "Breakin' Up", what's not to love? Gwen is a much better solo singer than in No Doubt.
Cementing herself as a pop staple with her debut, L.A.M.B., Stefani returns with a sophomore album that boasts as an athenaeum of marriage between zany dance-pop and classic slow-jam. Tracks such as Wind It Up, Breakin' Up, and Yummy are bizarre, jarring, and alien to the mainstream pop world. But with glistening production and perfect execution, Stefani delivers avant-garde in a time when pop was lacking such. The Sweet Escape is equally solidified by the aforementioned slow-jams. With tracks such as Fluorescent and U Started It, balancing out the upbeat circus that precedes them. In album where the product is complete, Early Winter and Wonderful Life beg to steal the show, as planets in a sky of stars.
Gorgeous iconic album, I don't know why people on here have been so negative.
"The sweet escape" remains one of the best albums of Ms Stefani, the divergeance is incredible include all different styles but this mixture wonder is always something that stopped me in this creation, it is really great
The album is incredible. Early Winter, 4 In The Morning and so many other tracks are well performed.
Recuerdo cuando en los años 90 Janet no se cansaba de decir que Madonna era vulgar y sin clase, parece que cuando hizo este álbum se mordió la lengua porque es de lejos lo más mugroso que ha hecho en toda su carrera.
i love the cd it has sooooooooooooo many good songs that make me smile when i have bad days how in the world does she hit the high notes?
I'm a big fan of Janet Jackson. I've bought all of her albums except for Dream Street (if anyone remembers that album). Some people would say that Dream Street was her low point. Janet has somehow managed to relive her Dream Street days on this release by trying to cater an audience that doesn't even realize Dream Street exists. It doesn't work.
Janet i love the cd is the biznezz!!!!!!!! Love You
Very average. I like about 4 songs. The rest is very bland.
Janet is the ultimate... I love the CD... I see her doing at least two more videos for this CD. She's an artist and a entertainer. If you've been a fan of Janet's over the years then you'll understand this CD... and trust their will be many more to come... I love you Janet... Your biggest fan... Rep... Dallas, TX
quintessential janet. i love it
It is a great step up for Janet. I hope this C.D. will let America know that she is a true star and not just a nipple.
I can't stop listening to this album. I love every song! I am a huge Janet Jackson fan and this album is certainly not a dissapointment. Don't listen to negative reviews. They probably haven't even heard the album, and are just trashing her because of her brother, superbowl, etc... This album is definitely worth the 9.99 and I own 6 copies. Go out and buy the album now if you haven't! Highlight tracks include "So Excited", "Show Me", "Get It Out Me", "Do It 2 Me", "With U", "Enjoy, and "Take Care". That's more than 1/2 the cd right there.
Good or bad, don't trust the reviews. There are a lot of biases towards and against Janet right now. Judge this album for yourself. If you can forget about her last name, forget about her brother, forget about the darn superbowl, I can't imagine you wont at least feel it was worth the 9.99 it cost to buy. Janet delivers.
Rather than rip my clothes off, this album makes me want to put a bag over my head and breathe deeply. This doesn't even seem like the same genre as No Control or Rhythm Nation, when her talent actually eclipsed that of her brother before he decided ogling little Middle Eastern boys was a worthwhile profession. It seems that she is trying way too hard to regain a sliver of cultural cache after her faux pas on national television with song titles that my kids could scratch on an Etch-A-Sketch. Leave the song misspellings to Prince and some Meta-critics, Janet.
Great CD!! Much better without the interlubes, it has a better flow.
a very strong album. i really love the 2nd single "so excited" great video! back to the best that janet does...great dance numbers!
the sogns that really standout are the jerry jame and terry lewis ones. the jermaine dupri produced tracks ae notvery exciting. two of his production, though,do standout. "show me" and "with u" are nice tracks, teh latter being one of the best tracks.
I love you janet wow!!!!!
Great Beats! 1st half is very funky and very dancy!! 2nd half is a bit slow for me but I think this album is definately better/more successful than Damita Jo
Janet brought it with this record the production is on point the songs are timeless and JD took it to a new level make way for the return on the Queen. it's easy to see how this album will make #1. Great body of work!
What ever happened to the originality that she had on her previous albums ? It's all gone, especially since Damita Jo. It's like she lost all of her inspiration that made her early music sound so much better than the rest. I think she should keep M.Dupri in the bedroom and out of the studio. What success has he had lately ?
Pleasant, but with too few stand outs. Probably won't put her back on top of the R&B scene.
I liked the songs after the 2nd listen, the song "enjoy" is the one I keep going back to that wasnt produced by JD. WIth any artist your either going to love it or hate it. I love anything Janet puts out because I know she will give us some music to chew on awhile. People who comment about her in the negative sense were not fans of hers from the beginning so the talk is pure trash. Go buy this album, roll your windows down and " enjoy!"
Can't stop listening to it. Smokin!!
Su peor álbum.
One could consider this a comeback album for Janet Jackson, however; this album is severely flawed. Although the production is modern, there are some questionable production methods that ruin certain songs from their true potential. There are only about three good songs on the album. Still I was surprised, I didn't expect any good songs from Janet and this album is a heck of a lot better than other "modern" R&B artist. In particular this is a lot better than the new Beyonce album on levels. Not really a good album, but definitely an above average album coming from an artist that seems to be coming out of a slump.
Her best album since Velvet Rope...
This album is a huge dissapointment...once again. It's been nearly a decade since Janet's put out a album worthy of putting her name on the cover. 20 Y.O. is garbage.
1st listen, its okay, 2nd and 3rd you really appreciate the work that went into making this CD. My kids were like no not Janet Jackson, by the 3rd listen, they were humming and dancing to the tunes. There isn't a song I don't like. " Enjoy" and "Daybreak" make you feel good! Love the energy on "Do It 2 Me" "Get It out Me" Its a "Feel Good" and "Body Moving" CD - great for my workouts, and smiling when I'm walking my dogs!
it good di to me the shit so excited i hot come on so get get it
This is not Janet's best effort by a long shot, but it is also not her worst (Damito Jo.) The one thing that is lacking is that it feels less like a Janet Jackson record and more like a compilation of new songs that Janet just happened to like. There is very little continuity. However, many of the songs are wonderful -- it's a great collection of new Janet songs that I am really happy to listen to!
Great album
20 YO: A Celebration! Welcome back Janet! There is a great mix of dance, funk, and soul! "Get It Out Me", "This Body", "Daybreak", "With You" and "Enjoy are some highlights. Worth the $14 for the CD!
I just bought six copies of Janet's album cause I just can't get enough! All the songs are great and are what I expected from her, with a drop of "ghetto". For those of you who don't already have the album, please go buy it today, and for those of you who have, BUY ANOTHER ONE! GREAT SONGS AND BEATS!
Great album. I thought it woud be horrible, but I think it's better than Maraih Carey's "Emancipation of MIMI" and WAAY better than Beyonce "B-Day". Im really enjoying it!
I've never heard of her before.
Bom CD R&B, com produção em sua maioria feita por Jermaine Dupri, que na época tinha um relacionamento amoroso com Janet. O Cd tem a romântica balada "Call on Me", com participação de Nelly que foi a música mais marcante do álbum.
Such an Amazing come back since Damita Jo is a terrible album. This album is mainly intended for dancing but it ends up working. I highlight tracks as Call on Me, do it 2 me, Get it out Me and So Exited.
Apesar de pouca semelhança aos seus trabalhos iniciais, Jackson arrisca em uma nova produção em seu último trabalho pela Virgin. Ainda como consequência do desastroso Halftime no Superbowl, Janet ainda é eclipsada, o que faz com que um ótimo trabalho não seja observado como deve.
Pior álbum dela sem dúvida alguma, Dupri fez do álbum o que ele quis e saiu um álbum cheio de demos, apenas "So Excited" chama atenção, pois o resto são músicas totalmente mal feitas com letras genéricas.
Really fun dated 200's rnb pop that doesn't attempt to be many things beyond playful and sexy. It might not be amongst her best but it's among her most accessible and fun,like All For You it doesn't build itself around a narrative that would often anchor her older classics. It is mire air tight than All For You but none of the songs are as infectious as the latter's iconic title track. It's an average record but shouldn't be a disappointment fir fans or newcomers.
Whoever let her record this crap should get arrested the minute she was allowed inside the studio. How can someone in perfect mental health listen and relax to this ? Pure **** ZERO
Let me start by saying that this is not a bad album. I don’t know if Janet did this album fast because she wanted it to be released on Control's 20th anniversary, but the album sounds like generic 2000s R&B with some some exceptions like Take Care, Enjoy and So Excited
See, I find it curious that Janet has been trying to be authentic to herself with every album she makes, especially with Velvet Rope, but, now that I think about it, before All For You, she was trying to hop on hip-hop tracks and show her versatility, as always. But she was trying to make an album that represented how she was feeling at the time, so she made a pop album, All For You. After that, she did kind of do the hip-hop thing with Damita Jo, but the Super Bowl happened and sales didn't come through. So she had to make a generic and trendy album, 20 Y.O. By no means this album is bad, however, I just find it unoriginal and bland, with the exceptions of With U, Daybreak, Enjoy and Take Care. It's a well produced album, but it's uninspired lyrically and not very diverse or consistent in its sound. So yeah, not a bad album, but also not an album I would go back to.
That is my favorite album ever! All the songs are just magical and awesome. The full project sounds very good, i listen to it everyday. I'm pretty sure that this album just have a bad reputation cause of the media. If was a man releasing this, it would be sucessful until today.
20 Y.O. is full of barely any hits and just full of bland, tedious dance track fillers that add nothing to her career. All the songs are very loud, boring, and lacks in anything new and exciting. Lyrics aren't up to the standards of Janet at her peak, and her voice is the only highlight of all songs. Love 2 Love by far is the worst on the album! #ugh
Better than the first album by a long shot. Warmly produced with nice dark lyrics that belie the jumpy tunes, "Ta-Dah" is one of the more twisted party records out there. Why do a lot of people cite "Ooh" as their least favorite track, btw? I've been noticing that and don't understand at all. That song makes me wanna dance my balls off. So good.
Loved their first album. This one is a dud. Only "I Don't Feel Like Dancing" is good (one song, one star). If you like broken down pianos and and when dance bands go honky tonk, then Ta-Da is for you. I just can't believe I waited two years for this! Any one know of a Scissor Sisters replacement band?
Another winner by the Sisters. It took a few listens, though, to warm up to as opposed to their debut album from 2004 which basically grabbed you by the cajones from track 1 and didn't let go. Several tracks have already burrowed a permanent home in my ear drums. As I've mentioned before, the Leo Sayer-tastic single "I Don't Feel Like Dancin'" is a winner. That segues into my favorite track off the album: "She's My Man" (the bastard love child of Elton John's "All the Young Girls Love Alice," "I'm Still Standing," and "Hey Papa Legba"). If it wasn't for the 5+ minute length of the song, I'd say that it would be the pick for the next single. The two Queen-esque music hall numbers "Intermission" and "I Can't Decide" are two more faves from the album. "Spot the Influence" is a game that works quite well with some of my other favorites from this album. There's the Duran Duran vibe of "The Other Side" and the Blondie "Call Me"-era disco rock of "Kiss You Off." (YAY, Ana Matronic!) The addition of a brass section to some of the new repertoire recalls the horn flourishes of the attempted dance rock on Elton John's 1985 album "Ice on Fire"...but much more successful. The only thing that the album could have used was a big epic number like the fantastic "Return to Oz" from their debut. It also would have been cool to have a really crunchy disco-rock number like "Music is the Victim" from their debut album. The closest to this on the new album is "Paul McCartney," an awesome frenetic dance-pop number that really doesn't sound like anything Macca ever did. Overall, "Ta-Dah" is a harder pill to swallow than its predecessor, but one you won't regret once you get it down. It's a great solid collection that proves the first album wasn't a fluke and it's one that's going to be hard to top this year.
Ok its definitely not as good as the first album but its still pretty good.
Sometimes you just want to put on a CD that will put you in a good mood and make you wanna dance around the house.
Ta-Dah is an electrifying if somewhat lyrically pessimistic dance album. The Scissor Sisters have successfully mined and re-invented the 1970s sound for a new century. The party they dramatically kicked off with their first brilliant album is still going strong. It
Following up to an enormous ride can be difficult, even with great producers/songwriters/performers coming to your aid. after a whirlwind first go round, the scissor sisters are here to ensure that Ta-Dah does command respect and even revere at the fact that even under pressure and a watchful eye, joy can still exude! Their dark lyrics upon the crazy, foot stomping music, suggest that they believe they are in fact the second coming of all things glamrock. From the Elton John piano riffs, to the David Bowie Kitsch, this album will definetly prove just what the Scissor Sisters intended.....Ta-Dah......
I love this cd... Not as great as their debut ....but NOONE's ever is.
I refuse to believe that I am the only person who thinks, I dont feel like dancing, is the most irritating, cheapest, awful song of 2006! I dont get it, because I liked their debut, this sounds like a karoke version of the band, its horrible!!!!!
I really like this album and I'm glad I bought it. The Scissor Sisters were one of those bands where I thought: I like the first album enough to go straight out and buy the 2nd. I did, and I'm very pleased I did, even if it was just for such great songs as She's My Man and Ooh.
Fun, frothy,frivolous but insubstantial would best sum up this second album. Its always difficult for any band making that second much anticipated record and by and large this succeeds. There are some good catchy songs and just the hint that there maybe a lit more depth to the sisters than what they've shown so far.It would be a shame if they fell into the trap of sticking to the same formula for future albums as a few tracks have just a hint of the melancholy and more meaningful undertones which they could have explored a little more. Thats not to say theres anything at all wrong with making fun music but you do wonder just how much more mileage is left with the scissor sisters particular brand of cheesy but fun 80's inspired music. I hope they take the shackles off for the next album. All in all a successful second album and a worthy successor to the first but you sense they could do better.
Great album, sounds a lot like Bee gees but still unique. Love it
This album is a glorious exaltation of how life can suck when all you do is party, and of how decadent the supposedly "care-free" life can become. "Ta-Dah" encapsulates the psychology of the compulsive partier to such a degree that to listen to the album makes you wonder whether you want to dance or shudder with fear. An amazing roller coaster ride of an album, you'll get sucked in and swept away by the Scissor Sisters whether you want to go or not!
I love it! Like previous comments light cheerfull and something you can sing to and enjoy.
I did not have the first album when I bought Ta Dah but after listening to this fantastic album I am completely hooked and the album has not left my car or my house since I bought it, it gets me jiggng from start to finish and there is not one song that I do not like. P.s I now have the first album which I love equally as much
This album is so much fun, not many albums make we want to get up and dance...
A disappointing album, Scissor Sisters show no improvement with their new release. In fact. they have taken a step backwards production wise with an even more retro approach. While their previous album was refreshing, hip, and sexy; they have gone overboard with the 70's feel invading both their song writing and their production. This all leads to an album that sounds like an actual album from the 70's. Rather than adding anything new to the genre they sound boring and more of an imitation of the real thing.
More layered than their debut, Scissor Sisters' Ta-Dah is a welcome & unique addition to popular music. When everything on MTV sounds the same, the Sisters bitch slap the audience out of their stupor & drag 'em onto the dancefloor.
What an amazing album!! Very nice!!
Significantly better than their first album.
It's a slick album and I don't pay too much attention to the sort of "they're not cool enough to deserve our attention" reviews. As someone once said, "a song is a song is a song" and I'm not impressed with how "non commercial" a band is supposed to be, they're all in it to make a buck/pound etc.. There are some beautifully crafted songs on here and I bought the album on the basis of having heard a few from the last one and I'll definitely be going out to get that one too.. And, if it's "better", then it just goes to show how difficult it is to follow up a great album, ask Michael Jackson, or Fleetwood Mac, but they both got over it! Rich. x
The stand out track and lead single on this album, 'I Don't Feel Like Dancin', is a collaboration between Scissor Sisters and their idol Elton John. Combining disco, glam-rock/pop and gay-club influences, the Scissor Sisters were one of the biggest buzz bands in Australia in 2006, with fans loving their camp sense of fun (they had similar success in the UK). A great follow up to their self-titled debut.
4 star CD from the best rock-disco band out there. If only US radio would get on the bandwagon and give them a chance.... There are several instant classics on this CD - songs that are totally original yet recall the best 70's party pop. Besides the first single "I Don't Feel Like Dancin'", check out "Paul McCartney" and "Everybody Wants The Same Thing." Scissor Sisters are astute students of rock history and it shows.
first single is one of the best of the year; after a few listens of the album, you'll be completely hooked.
its straight, no pun intended....
Catchy, but too outdated and plastic to be enjoyable. Listen to the Bee Gees instead.
Smacks more of a tribute band than the real deal. The singing is so-so and the sound is ripped off from Abba-Gees-Summer-Queen-somethin-somethin.
A great album that takes an even more 70s vibe than the first. This is straight up disco with a darkly humourous undercurrent. Other than "Ooh" which I think is a bit of a dud, this is a hopping album. "I Can't Decide" and "She's My Man" are the standouts.
If you're expecting a retread of their first album, you'll be disappointed. It takes a few listens to click. But then, my ultimate favorite songs on their first cd weren't the ones that popped for me initially either. I have to withhold judgment on what the best songs are on this one for a month or two!
What it lacks in fun and originality, it makes up for in slick production. It's neither better nor worse than their debut, it's simply different. It may be more commercial in comparison, but it's far more polished too. It showed progression and a new richness to their sound. It suited the band's success. It'll never be quite as cherished as their debut, but you can't dislike an album that's this well made.
This album is much messier and more dissonant than the first. The songs on the first album just fit together much better.
This album makes me want to grab a popsicle and spend all afternoon dancing in the sunshine.
I hate all synthpop actually but I really loved the song Minimal, it has good beats and is dreamy it's not like the other songs on this album. I don't like Pet Shop Boys but Minimal is a really awesome song.
politics+war+humor+heartache+perfect
Very nice album.I happen to like every tune!!!At leest some quality in these years.Finaly the good music is returnining thorough them.
These guys are among the most under rated musicians of the past twenty plus years. Well crafted music, with intelligent lyrics. What's not to like. If some of the singles off this album get some radio play, watch out, the boys could be back.
Astonishing
I've heard the comparisons to Very, but I personally don't think Fundamental holds up to it. The album starts off with great song that really draws me in, but it starts to lose me as the album goes on.
I love the beats to the album. They are quick, hip and great to listen to anytime. Songs such as I'm with Stupid, The Sodom and Gomorrah Show and Integral are the hghlight tracks on this good achievement.
Excellent album! I enjoyed their last album, Release, but this is even better than that album! It has a retro feel to it, moreso than their other albums. The PSB's have always seemed ahead of the game with their brand of electronic pop, but this is a bit of a step back. Usually, that's a bad thing, but the PSB's pull it off wonderfully here. There are a few tracks here that are obviously political and they do a great job with not beating your head with overt-political attacks. Great stuff!
"Psychological", "20th Century" and "I Made My Excuses And Left" are instant classics!
Not one bad song on it!! Iput it in the player and go from start to finish without once hiting the skip on my remote!!!!!! I don't know about you guys but I have only a hand full of CDs that i can say that about!!!!!!!
I don't get what all the hoopla is about. I am a lifelong PSB fan, and I think this is the weakest album they have put out in years and years. It's sad, I really wanted to like it.
to hear the lp that SHOULD have been released, keep an eye out for the limited edition double cd featuring remixes by Richard X, Michael Mayer etc...PSB's obviously were not totally sold on Trevor Horn's basic production, and wanted to give more sophisticated fans somethng fresher.
It's a solid album with a couple of really good songs, but it doesn't compare to Very at all. I am enjoying my time listening to it, but I don't think it'll have much longevity.
lacks the romance of 'Very', no great love song like"liberation". The Sodom and Gomorrah Show stays in my head like a bad dream. There's nothing to match "young offender" either. Still quite good.
They're Back!!! Awesome.
over-the top, fun, and slightly sinister; everything a PSB album should be. Not up there with the heights of "VERY" but very solid, with the exception of "numb" which I skip over.
Like a representative sampler of all the things they do well, this album will not so much recruit new fans as keep the ones they have. Like their whimiscal and mischevious countrymates New Order, PSB are showing their age. Unlike NO who write the occassional tremendous song among many average ones, the PSB create more consistent rewarding material, more often than not. Their ambition does not exceed their grasp where as NO usually can't be bothered. Fundamental is solid effort from start to finish and while not a Very or Behavior, it remains Essential. Being back does not apply. They never left as the album shows. They do this, or that, or mix it all together - opulent, theatrical, and a thing of beauty. As Tennat once said "camp is not a row of tents".
Amazing, such enjoyable electro-pop with such depth. Possibily one of the most accomplished pop acts of all time.
Pet Shop Boys are amazing. This latest work is no less great and fun then any of their other work over the past 2 decades (is that 3 now?) It is like a soundtrack to life. Keep it up boys!
Best album of the year.
Utterly brilliant and back to their best.
A stunning return to form - thei Pet Shop Boys best album since 'Behaviour'? Possibly!. The tracks cover high energy electro pop, moody mid-tempo numbers and mournful ballads .. all tunes feature smart lyrics and are topped off with fantastic production by Trevor Horn.
Good to hear they're back. Much, much better than the recent series lackluster albums before this.
solid. I thought Release was quite a let down, and Behavior is one of my favorites. The sparks were just not flying, but with fundemental the ship has definitely been righted. Solid hooks, great melodies, some lyrics laughable, but all in all a solid effort. I'm happy to say unlike other artists that have fallen in their last efforts like the Cure for instance, PSB have restored my faith with this album and have reminded me why I loved them in the first place.
okay; damnation you can dance to. I'm sure this CD is popular in hell. Bleah.
Delightful, campy and endlessly entertaining.
One of their best.
Fundamental is Fundamental hahahahahahahaha,Okey this joke was a ****But this album is Great...The Sodom And Gomorrow Show,Integral,Indefinite Leave To Remain,Casanova In Hell,Numb and Twentieth Century,I Made My Excuses And Left,God Willing,Luna Park and I'm With Stupid Are absolute great songs of PSB Career
..........................................................................Fundamental.............................................Of...............................PSB.........................................................................Is........Fundamental.................For The.............Music.................
average album, echo of debut only...
E6's debut spawned 2 top 10 British hits and was featured on Rolling Stones and Spin's best 2005 lists. Such reception would normally warrant a big push for the second release, but instead the label choose to not promote the album at all and choose a weak single in Radio Ga-Ga, a track Dick Valentine didn't even want on the album. Albeit these difficulties, Valentine managed to put out a solid follow-up filled with infectious hooks and clever lyrics. Do not make the mistake of others of writing of the 6 as a novelty act.
This album is cranked full of amazing songs, in particular look out for: Dance-A-Thon 2005 Boy Or Girl Future Boys Be My Dark Angel.
Cant top their live show, but nonetheless, this album brings the funk, fun, and good get down dance music. Wakes me up better than coffee in the morning.
Fire was a near-10, but Senor Smoke just doesn't sound complete. Almost every song from Fire surprised me, even with repeated listens. But on the new one, almost every song has parts of it that sound choppy or piecemeal. A little too much synth and not enough guitar on this one either. Great lyrics as always, though.
Not as good as their previous album "Fire" but well worth the listen.
Not quite as good as Fire, mainly because of "radio ga ga" which was a condition of the albums release and was not intended to be on the album by the band. Critics that reviewed this are the worst ever.
This album has some great rock songs, but the musical direction and the musicians are different from the first record; people that give a low rating do so mainly because they think all bands should stick to the same pattern over and over and over. Electric six changes on every record, and that's for the better.
A new step forward for these guys. I got the British import over a year ago so I've listened to this album a lot. More thought out and fuller than their previous album. Definatley worth checking out.
In 2003, The Electric Six put out an album that mocked rock while exemplifying everything that's great about it. Their follow up is more of the same. Senor Smoke features some songs from the Six's back catalog and some high quality new tracks. The label mishandled this album, the result of which was poor sales due to lack of promotion and a weak single in Radio Ga-Ga, arguably the album's weakest track. The latter, however, had no effect on the quality. Senor Smoke brings Valentine's lyrics to the forefront and the result is astounding. Fire showed only a hint of what Dick is capable of and fans will be pleased to know that a third release is scheduled for late 2006. One of the best releases of 2005 for sure.
This is a solid rock album with lofty lyrics. I think that anyone that gives this album a low rating hasn't listened to it enough. Most of these reviews don't justify the rating the goes with it anyway. If the album's so bad, why give it a forty and not a zero?
It's got a place in my heart this one, don't overanalyse these guys, they are here for a good time not for a long time and if you just go for the ride you can have a truckload of laughing smiling jumping good time.
"Mr President, make a little money sending people you don't know to Iraq. Mr President I don't like you, you don't know who to ROCK!!"God, I love Electric Six. Their first two albums are fan-bloody-tastic. I think they upped the comic ante in this one following 'Fire', but I still marginally prefer Fire. Hilarious band that get my adrenaline pumping every time
I must say that I never really paid attention to Madonna until this album. I became a fan when i heard Confessions on a Dance floor. It's great for parties and for just a person dancing in the room. For me, it's the best Madonna album to date.
Yet another masterpiece from the unstoppable Madonna!
The album Madonna fans have been waiting for!
This album is dance music par excellence.
Album Of the Year!!!
This is my favourite album!!! It's simply great! Best dance album ever!!!! The sounds are incredible, the lyrics are fantastic, her voice is great!!! Love this album and love "Hung Up" and "Jump" my favourite songs! The album start with "Hung Up", probably the best track. When you hear this song your body starts to dance! Then there are "Get Together" and "Sorry" that are really good. The CD continues with "Future Lovers", "I Love New York", "Let It Will Be" and "Forbidden Love" that are excellent dance songs!!! And then there are "Jump" ( for me the second best track, then Hung Up ) "How High", "Isaac" ( great! ) "Push" and "Like it or not". All great tracks! "Confessions" is one of Madonna greatest CDs with "True Blue" and "Like a Prayer". I Love this!!!!!! ( sorry for my English )
The songs are amazing! The album is best enjoyed in its entirety. And the lyrics, if paid attention to, is really good.
This is the madonna i love!!!!
amazing
very goooooood
Madonna's an artist I've discovered in the recent years. I'd heard her in Snatch's soundtrack. Also saw her older hits on TV every now and then. I found she had a very lively spirit. I don't like her much nowadays, because she acts way too much like she's meant to be treated like a royalty. True reflexion of what celebrity does to you. Except yeah, the album's solid! I found a good bunch of songs actually good to listen to, for an artist such as Madonna. Letdowns were the Americanisation song such as New York. As smart as Madonna claims to be, that song just reeked idiocy. Overall, the songs have really good melodies and Madonna shows political tolerance by using many different styles of harmonies in her songs. I think Mirwais probably helped her out on this CD, but Mirwais is a good artist anyways, so props. Buy it, it's worth it. Especially if you like to dance.
A rcih sounding album amzim tracks and diverse will please anyone!!!!
One of her best works till date. As each song segues into the next and grows on you, you just cannot stop listening to the whole album once you sit down with Hung Up. Each track is amazing, from the 80's love beats in Forbidden Love to the hyperactive Jump. Brilliant stuff!
Pros: - Great and extremely dancable music! - Music is consistently good Cons: - Some samples sound suspiciously similar to stuff from recent popular dance hits!
I would like to give 12!
One of Madonna's best albums in years...
Brilliant! (with a British accent)
Retrospective Review:It's hard to imagine Madonna topping up her best album, Ray of Light, but Confessions on the Dancefloor is the BEST album from Madonna since her Ray of Light era with its interesting concept and catchy disco-electronica tracks that are been overlooked by most people.Highlights: Hung Up, I Love New York, Forbidden Love, Jump, Issac and Push.Personal Favorties: Everything in this album.
AMAZING !!!this albums is a huge success!one of the best albums and the best dance album of the 00'sMadonna went back to her roots and once again returned to the top!what i love about this album is the 70's disco vibes from The pet shop boys, Donna summer, John Travolta etc. etc.QUEEN OF MUSIC
Confessions on a dance floor is the definition of madonna. Groovy beats and some of her best vocals (get together). Each song could be a single and it's a non stop dance journey. The ultimate pop album for me.
Love it. Explosive and classic. Madonna is a true genius! I was expecting a huge chorus like "Hung Up" and "Sorry" in the others songs of the album, but they just was almost there... PS: Loved "Isaac". Perfect song.
the best and the first pop dance album, any artist will make something like this, ever. the enitire album is such a masterpiece, my favorite ever, she changed the game with this
Quiza el mejor disco de Madonna despues de True Blue, esa combinacion de musica dance europea con el pop americano dio como resultado uno de los mejores discos de la decada, Como artista con este disco demostro una vez ser una de las artistas mas revolucionarias de la industria. Es una fiesta llena de emociones que te hace olvidar de tus problemas. Larga vida a la reina.
The best album by Madonna in this century (and in her career, at least in my mind)! Any of songs are dance jams, that you can dance til today! "Sorry" is just an adictive piece of song btw.Also title of this album is very good, since it's lyrical content are actually confessions or problems, while musically album is very very dancey.
This album seems ethereal among other Madonna releases. It has an excellent production and the released singles are top tier.
Another derivitave attempt at reviving a moribund career from this long in the tooth bandwagon jumper, who burns through dance production "collaborators" (read: creators) the way Angelina Jolie burns through male co-stars. Perhaps old Esther should work at perfecting her English accent and recycling her Kaballah cult's ideas into kiddie books instead, because the music ain't happening. Pathetic.
I'm starting to realise Madonna is a brand that's been overhyped from day one. She's never broken any ground artistically and her vocals and lyrics aren't up too much. A weak album from a weak artist trying very very hard to stay on the scene,
I like artists that never use the music of others,this shows that Madonna can't make her own sound never,she is always changing it to get success,what a pity,it shows also that she dont have creativity and talent for compose.
About as repetitive, unoriginal, nonsensical, repetitive as most of Madonna's songs in recent history. A lot of the lyrics are just dumb, everything is incredibly repetitive, and all the songs sound pretty much the same, only barely reaching distinguishable. Also, it's repetitive.
i love madonna but i don't like this album. generic inexpressive and faceless music.
To be honest, I have never been much of a Madonna fan, but for whatever reason, I assumed I would love this record. Wrong! I was shocked after one listen how I had little or no interest in listening to it again. Her vocals never leave the ground. To make dance music exciting, the vocalist must soar into the disco rafters. She simply hasn't got the pipes. (The same reason the film of "Evita" was so flat.) And the lyrics! Sometimes (as in the New York number) they are downright embarrassing! A supreme disapointment! Let's allow Madonna to settle into motherhood, and let's all move on to something more interesting... Byebye, Mrs. Ritchie!
I have to disagree with Henry T when he suggests that Madonna has 'never borken any ground artistically" See Like A Prayer and Ray of Light in particular...The reason this album is so disappointing is that Madonna no longer seems to want to push herself artistically and his happy to settle for commercial, lyrically weak dance music that will satisfy her finances rather than her creative energy.
They were playing this the other night when I was at the gyn. I thought about just letting the bar crush my skull. Awful, awful "music"
I prefer Enya to this ....... thing,because its have her own style,never changed,and have talent. Enya is the real music.
There are only a few highlights, such as the single "Hung Up," and overwhelmingly the songs mesh into one repetitive whole, leaving you bored and feeling cheated. Vision and uniqueness are heavily lacking on "Confessions..." I would recommend only buying the single if it's peaking your interest.
These are words from a huge fan of Madonna, a man who owns all of her albums: this is the worst thing she's ever done. What a shame.
My favorite singer is Maddona and her song confessions on a dance floor.
Unbelievably repetitive. It's like hearing the SAME song over and over again for an hour. I guess she's just a singles artist to me. Hung up is a good song.
bad
if there was negative score I would score - the biggest number ever. She should not be allowed to make another album after her deathworthy verison of American Pie.
Instead of pushing the envelope, Madonna seems to have put herself in one and sent herself to 1976. Unfortunately, the best disco was in that era and Madonna is no match for Ms Summer or even Abba. A sad state of affairs.
Meh-donna. I'll be honest, I got through song six and had to turn it off. Brutal.
Surprised that people like it as much as they do. I think it's sort of mediocre.
gostei da música Sorry, que tem um uma duração grande como outras do álbum em média de 4/5 minutos de duração, algumas dela são 2 minutos de sonoridade sem vocal nenhum. haja paciência.
Speechless. Spellbound. Amazed. Honestly, I am 17, and I never in my wildest dreams expected a 48 year old popstar to make probably the best, the most breathtaking, the most stunning dance-pop album ever. The album is beyond excellent. Lyrically great, musically and production wise on a whole different level. Hate to admit it, but no artist can pull an album this mind-blowing past 40. One of the greatest and most iconic albums of all time. Deserved all of the incredible amount of success it had and more. Must listen!!
this is exactly the best album in her career every song is perfect on this album (except i love new york) this album is part of my childhood and i love it
Muito ruimmm, parece um monte de demos descartadas, que foram recicladas e jogadas nesse album lixoso. É essa a mulher q revolucionou o pop? llkkkkkkk Claro que nao né?
I wish people would just give up with whole "hate" thing they have for Maddy...so much energy waisted....if you dont like dancing or fun then just DON'T listen to the album...stick to enya and the rest....in the meantime i'll get into her groove and hit the dancefloor....
Really enoyable record.
Her best EVER !!!
There's irony in damning Madonna in the name of Jesus
I really like this album, even if at times some tracks appear to be thrown together with DJ mixes to "sound good." I don't think it's her best, that would be Ray of Light. However, the effort put forth into this album as compared to American Life, or Bedtime Stories, certainly proves that it's not all about her image.
Her best work yet. Really, one of the best pure pop records of all-time. Destined to be a classic.
its basically okay.. the tunes are catchy, andsometimes experimental(push) but the problem is bout 90% of the album sounds the same.. fthermore the album flows continuously.. bcuz of that, ii sometms dun know that im actually listening to the next song
I like this album very much. This is the best album i ever heard. Fantastic!
This album is amazing.It contains great songs like "Sorry" & "Get Together".
Love the album as a whole...I love New Yok and HUUng UP wake me up every time!
Yeah, this album is definitly one of the greatest Electronica/Dance albums of the 2000's. Only "Jump" and "Sorry" are a little "out of key" for me. The rest is excellent. Why the fu** did she change her co-producers and chosed Timbaland for "Hard Candy"?!
Madonna at her exhilarating best,love the future disco,Confessions is a timeless album.
Madonna at her absolute best! A faultless album from the Queen of Pop. Easily up there with her best.
Words cannot describe!
This is a flawless album. Not a dud in the bunch. Her best in years.
Very good, i absoutly love this album, and that its a continous mix, WOW! I could listen to this or dance to it for hours!
Album Of the Year!!!
Not a single mis-Fire WOW! Impressed by her all over again!
Madonna gives us a new perspective on tracks on a cd, a almost never ending storie from begining to end, it's like you almost can't tell when one storie ends and the next one begins, it's perfect!!!!!!
Yup... I hate to admit it... But this is good.
Madonna can still move a crowd.
Yes, I'm outside the norm in saying this album is okay, not great. Having heard albums such as Kerrier District's Kerrier District and Kelley Polar's Love Songs of the Hanging Gardens, I know there are better disco-sounding records out there that capture the spirit of disco moreso than Confessions on a Dance Floor.
Futuristic. Amazing. Full of fun and authentic joy of dancing and singing. Love it!
This is Madonna's best album since "Ray of Light". All these are catchy and are easy to dance to. The queen is back in a big way!!!
utter brilliance! cant fault it in any way. to the negative comments...why is the music never spoke about. it seems people only want to trash the woman no matter what and ignore the actual work. either that or its a dumb statement that reveals that the person doesnt like pop/dance music anyway, so why bother saying anything? get a life
hung up,brilliant fabulous pop song,obviously the strongest on the cd,the rest a little patchy for me ,a little too much euro disco pap, but over all good,but i still think that american life was better
best cd since ray of light
Not as deep as her last few albums, but a whole lot of fun. This one wisely avoids the politics of American Life, and returns Madonna to where she belongs - the whirling dance floor. It's all catchy and goofy fun, but does seem a little safer than she ever has before.
It simply rocks.
Great album, not her all time best... but a welcome change from American Life! She can definitely still give the younger wannabes a run for their money! This album is probably the closest sounding to her original style with a sure fire club & radio appeal!
ok what is it wih the 80's Nothing different, deja-vue. 2 much effects is like not enough. Lyrics .....;-(
User comments is not a forum for guerilla marketing... get out of here people!
Igore the hype and the professional morons out there: "Oh my god she's like, er 47, or something and she's like still breathing, how is that possible? How can someone soooo old make like music anyway? Shouldn't be allowed should it. And look at how she dresses. Does not compute, does not compute." It's Madonna people. Get over it already. Plain and simple it's a great companion piece to "Ray of Light" and if you didn't like that album you won't like this one, so don't bother. However for anyone who likes decent, no scub that, good music - and I do - get the album right now. Is it camp? Yes. Is it loud? God yes. Is it a dance album? Definately. But I don't like dance music? Then don't buy it. But I don't like Madonna? Then don't buy it. I like Madonna, but only her 80's stuff? Who knows you might like it. Try it. I like 'real' dance music, but Madonna, come on? Oh you will like this baby, trust me. Now I'm not some obessive Madonna fan, just a fan of music. Period. And this is either the best or 2nd best album she's ever been involved in. It's also a contender for album of the year in my honest humble opinion. Personal Fav being Elbow "Leaders of the Free World". Great album. Nuff said.
Great music, she is still hot
very beautiful.
Incredible return to form! Without a single duff track, this is right up there with Like A Prayer and Ray Of Light!
im so glad its back to the old madonna
Great Great ALBUM! Non Stop FUN!
This is Madonna's best release since "Ray of Light". Every song is highly stylized and VERY danceable and upbeat. It's nice to have "fun" Madonna back.
Her best since Like A Prayer!
It's good. Doesn't really have enough up-beat songs but it's great anyways.
Easily the best Madonna album I've ever heard. If 'Jump', 'Sorry', and 'Push' are released as singles they will surely become number 1's.
Wow is the best descriptive word for "Confessions..", Madonna takes us by the jugular and doesn't let go for an hour. In turn sweet, sexy, spiritual, but always thumping and groovy. Standout tracks are Hung Up, Sorry, Jump, How High, Isaac, Push. This woman is so rightfully tagged Queen of Pop, there's a trail of pretenders in her wake, long may she reign!
Well, for sure, it is definitely her best album she put out in years! Especially compare to the dreadful 2003 release "American Life". Still, her voice gets a bit lost in all those multi layers of techno synths and progressive beats. But mostly, the lyrics are a little cheesy if not dumb sometimes. But overall, it's great to see Madonna back to stir this boring world of pop music dominated by hip-hop.
Repeated listenings reveal even greater pleasures in the lush songs. Lyrics are average, but when was dance music ever about the words? The beats are what count, and they deeply rock on this album.
If people don't like this album or Madonna for that matter then why, oh why are they wasting their time and ours by posting their views???? Get over it, Madonna rules, she can't be trash if she is NO 1 in the album and music charts RIGHT NOW!!! Just please. . .get. . .a. . .life!!!! Team Lamb can SHOVE IT!!!! Madonna is the queen of pop, always has always will be. . .FACT!!!! Bye! :)
All hail the Queen of Pop for the throne will be hers forever and EVER! Bloody amazing record! And cut the crap about the lyrics..you want lyrics go buy a Coldplay album or something! But while you still got this record..I dare you not to dance your ass off just listening to it! Go Madonna!!!
Amazing new work of Madonna, simple, awesome, just fun!!!!! You can dance, for inspiration!!!!
I just bought this one, and its one of her best... very dancey and upbeat... AWESOME!!!!!!
Great album, will make us all forget american life.
This album is amazing! I love this album. Madonna had made me a big fan. My favorites are Sorry, Push, Jump, Issaac, Future Lovers, Get Together...the whole album...lol.
I trully enjoyed this album:) It's the best of Madonna to date:)
This is a pleasant surprise! Madonna is back doing what she is supposed to do: entertain! American Life was an ill-judged attempt to educate rather than entertain and madonna has apparently learned that if she wants to maintain her relevance she should make us dance instead of think! Clever choice...and up goes the record sales!
Madonna simply the best!
Great music.
BEst album of year
After a dismal attempt in American Life, Confessions brings us back to who Madonna is, the maker of great music. I have listened to his album over a hundred times and still cannot get bored. Each time I listen I hear something new. The music is magical and gets me moving. She proves that she can once again defy the odds by making a great album.
I needed an album like this for christmas!
Simply Amazing. A feast for the ears!
Madonna just put out one of the worst albums of her career. I really not feeling anything she does. I wish she would just go away!!!!
Nomatter what she did, she always a leader not follower!
Confessions made another surprise when it debuted at No.1 in nearly 40 various country. Album managed to a massive improvement fro latest album effort American Life. So we oughta wish Madonna this huge success because when U R 47 year-old this is amazing´.
this album is amazing! i highly highly recommend it
The best pop - dance album of the latest years and definitely one of her best. (I am a fan since 1983) I had many years to enjoy a pop - dance album so much. It can be heard for months!
with Jump as single and Confessions Tour this summer, I can say that this album is my all time favorite! can not have enough of it
There are only a few good things on this album, and it's nothing she or anyone else hasn't done before. Formulaic, but sometimes fun in spite of it. This should be the last we hear from this woman, ever. Please!
Exciting cd from Madonna My favourite songs are Get together and Forbidden lovers. I do not know why many people do not like I love new York: the lyrics can be horrible but the music is absolutely wonderful
I can listen to this album over and over again. Our favorite 70s disco songs with an electronica overlay and lyrics. If you like Disco or even club music, this is a must have.
Aside from the brilliant lead single and a few other tracks, the album is pretty generic, icy dance pop.
This is one of madonna"s best albums ever
absolutly her best cd in almost a decade since ray of light, a pop album in its maximum expresion, with a twist of techno and disco. Enjoyable and give the old fans a new vibe to put their attention back to madonna and to the yonger crowds to follow her.
It is ok but not her best work,sometimes cold and distenced
Tracks 11 and 12 aren't so good, but everything else is excellent. "Jump" and "Sorry" are superb, just about as good as anything she's ever done. Much better than the overrated Ray of Light. Actually as good as any disc she's ever put out.
This is such a fun album and a long way from the introspection of Ray of Light and American Life. Okay not everything works but still she manages to teach the younger wanabees a thing or two. Still going strong after over twenty years, will we ever see another like her, IMO definitely not. I absolutely love madonna not because I've loved everythings shes done but because of her continual re-invention and change of musical styles. This album is one long disco night, full of fun, at times cheesy, at times a bit euro trash but just such an enjoyable ride.This makes you want to get up and dance and so delivers big time.
One of the best of her 13 so far!! Cannot stop listening to it!!
I really enjoy this album. I can repeat it many time which mean this album is not boring. Madonna, just released second album......i will be waiting.
AMAZING!!! This album had me dancing from the minute I put it on until it was finished.Lets not even get into what an amazing artist and entertainer she is. MADONNA is the greatest and anything she creates is a masterpiece.
Best album of her's yet. COADF simply grooves!!!
It seems like a strong effort on Madonna's part at fisrt, but the album gradually gets really old. It's decent and the songs are fun to dance to but that's about it. After a while, it's just kind of boring and dull.
Madonna never ceases to amaze me. Ever since 1983, I have thought that the day of Madonna was past, that her next album wouldn't sell, that the next tour would be boring, that she is too old and too rich to be able to reach out to listeners, has tried too many different fads, has pushed every button possible...and every single time, I am wrong. When I listen to her new single, or see her new video, I am speechless at her ability to change and present different personas successfully. After 17 official album releases, Madonna is still going stronger than ever with her latest release, Confessions on a Dance Floor.
Madonna returns to form with "Confessions". Next to "Ray of Light" this is her best work.
One's of the best album the last 10 years!
A great Madonna album, and you can "Like It Or Not."
Absolutely amazing. Makes you move and want to get up and dance. Such an amazing album from an already exceptional and influential musician. Madonna blows the competition away with her synth pop/dance album.
purrfect
Madonna needs to trade in her Cha Cha Heels for a wheelchair. How many times must she inflict her bad singing on the American public??? Give it up girl your minutes of fame are FINALLY dissapearing. And by the way maybe someone should turn her daughters on to the filthy media scandal she created in the past to keep her name in the media. Madonna, stay abroad we have enough bad pop music living right here in the US.
This album is AMAZING, Madonna is back at what she does best. WAY TOO GO
Her best EVER !!!
Best yet
Some of her BEST work ever!!!
I hope people who review this cd give a at least a weeks worth of listens. It is an amazing cd. Everytime I listen to it I am blown away at the incredible talent madonna has. Thanks for making such a top notch CD!!!!!!! To the CNN anchor who said American Life was a waste of 15.00, I just have to ask her, were you in the room when you listened to it???? Thanks Madonna, you indeed do rule the world!!!!!
This album is brilliant. As amazing as Hung Up is, it does not represent this album...Because it is based on heavy, dark dance beats, with confessional and revealing lyrics - about fame, fortune, love and family...But without any cynicism. Madonna has outdone herself. 12 perfect dance cuts.
this cd will get everybody into the groove.listen to it several times and you will get hooked to it.addicted even.
So catchy and fun - I understand the hype
The groove is unstoppable!!! Madonna - you just don't stop, do you???
Neither perfect nor the best album of Madonna's career, as many have claimed, the good news is "Confessions on a Dance Floor" is not as bad as I had feared, but that does not make it as good as I had hoped. It is what it is: a classy, occasionally exhilarating but frequently frustrating dance record from the reigning Queen of Pop. Producer Stuart Price's arrangements are quite good, but there is nothing particularly interesting about the music itself, save for the enthralling first single, "Hung Up". Madonna's vocals often get buried in the production, and the songs too often sound like convoluted remixes. The lyrics are generic at best ("Get Together", "Sorry", "Like It or Not") and downright inane at worst (the insipid "I Love New York"). While I sound like I am bashing the record, "Confessions" is more rewarding than I seem to be giving it credit for: the aforementioned "Hung Up", the pulsating "Future Lovers", the gorgeous "Forbidden Love", the introspective "How High", and the stunning "Push" are all standouts. It's a shame to compare (a critical faux pas I usually like to avoid), but perhaps "Confessions on a Dance Floor" is somewhat disappointing because I know Madonna has released better material in the past. I don't hate the album as it may seem; I rather think I enjoy it quite a bit. But I can't imagine it will ever get as much spin time as "Ray of Light" or "Music".
Pure.Bliss.
Throw it in your CD player and get ready to dance! Amazing piece of genius from our long standing Queen of Pop.
Pure dance odesssey!! Standout tracks include Hung Up, Sorry, Jump and Forbidden Love.
Some great dance tracks in here. But you have to wonder how much credit Madonnas producers get. Should this album not be Madonnas and Stuart Prices. The music and the beats are the best thing about it. Similar to previous tracks like "dont tell me", the genius was in the production, not the lyrics or singing. Madonnas greatest talent seems to be picking the flavour of the month to produce her albums eg. Mirwais, William Orbit, Price.
An Amazing Album! Even better than Gwen's Love.Angel.Music.Baby--this has the consistency and the commitment that the LAMB album lacks--the Queen Madge reclaims her throne!
Confessions is rather disappointing. It's formulaic and dull. The much hated American Life album had some edge to it. This is euro-dance-pop-cheece by numbers.
Although I do not like every song on the album, I am completely amazed by the transformation Madonna has gone through since her last album. The beats, the lyrics, everything about this album screams "fun" and I'm happy to say that this is the first album from Madonna in several years that I can actually say I listen to on a regular basis. Awesome~
madonna is back!!!!!!
Fantastic album. Check out the review by Slate Magazine above. I think it describes this album very well.
This album is a gigantic disappointment. The majority of songs are virtually unlistenable. Some of these lyrics make "Borderline" and "Lucky Star" look like Shakesperean sonnets. The tracks are not DJ-mixed, there are rather "blended" together. To much down time, too many foolish lyrics, boring melodies, lazy vocals, I almost threw the disc out the window of my car after my first listen and I've been a Madonna fan since 1983. Go listen to "Ray of Light" again instead.
Wow...I love Madonna. Now granted I did like American Life, but it wasnt amazing. This album is amazing. Every single song makes me want to get up and dance. Thank you Madonna for making this album!
The best album yet! Much better than her last. I put it in and starting dancing in my car! Awesome album! Thank you MADONNA!
I'm not a huge Madonna fan, but this is great dance music. She shoudl stick to this. Fun, hooky, and hip.
Totally uninspired album. Sounds like the lable needed an album and just threw it together in a weekend. Sounds like a long fart.
Brilliant
I'm not a huge Madonna superfan, but this CD absolutely kicks! I can't stop playing the WHOLE CD, I have it on repeat and refuse to turn it off, I particularly like Sorry, Jump, Push, and Hung Up is the best.
This is Madonna's most brilliant and best album since "Music." The best tracks are "Hung Up," "Get Together," Sorry," "I Love New York," and "Jump." It isn't as revolutionary as been documented. Madonna uses disco influences and inferences by the likes of Giorgio Moroder, The Jacksons, Kylie Minogue and The Pet Shop Boys. It's very European stylistically and futuristic musically. The album is straight through without pause but after a while you feel as if you've stayed too long on the dance floor because the songs start to sag a bit especially following the tedious song , "Issac."
Go M
Great album. Far better than the dreadful "American Life" and is far more consistent and enjoyable than "Music. Ranks up there with "Ray Of Light" as her best.
best madonna album in a long, long time... nice retro dance feeling to it. some songs are very 'basic' but album is effective... go get it!
She's back and better than ever. I dare you to not be amazed by this album.
A brilliant comeback after the disappointing "American Life". Thumping, driving club beats infused with emotional lyrics....I can't stop playing this album!
This is Madonna's "Thriller" It is nearly perfect and absolutely captures the mood of the country..Dammit! Lets Dance!
It's good, but the tempo is pretty much the same throughout...
A true return to form only Madonna could pull off. A truly fantastic trance/pop/dance album that shows the pretenders how music is supposed to be made. Another benchmark has been set, one which the copycats will almost certianly fail to better.
This CD is amazing. There isn't a single song you will want to skip past.
Every Song is at least good!
Ignore Ray Of Light, Music and the underrated American Life. This is the return to form for Madonna we've wanted since Bedtime Stories/Like A Prayer. She successfully melds the spirit and candor of Into The Groove with sounds from the future yet, decades old as well. Take Forbiddlen Love, which slyly incorporates the backbeat to 'Holiday'. On 'I Love N.Y', She sounds as happy to be in the music and in the light as she was when she launched her sound with 'Everybody' over 2 decades ago. The within COADF sound is 'every' Madonna era, rolled into all things. Yet, for all it's bravado, it works; and it works magically. Her best release in years. Screw modern Madonna, if you've wanted the spirit of old, here's your chance. Now get into the groove!
great dance album
Easy going and fun, I love it!
not really a madonna fan only ever enjoyed one or two songs from each of her previous alblums, but this is really great. Possibly her best yet
well, let me tell you that her album is stupid pop, well, let me tell you that this cd has 80's mixed songs with dumb-gay lyrics, it isn't any new shit, it really sucks
This is sad. It's just sad. This is an obvious, pathetic attempt for Madonna to jump onto the latest bandwagon (in this case "neo-80s" or whatever they may be calling it -- wasn't that trend about 2 years ago, anyway?). She should have learned her lesson after her laughable obligitory Bush-bashing album. Frankly, this album would be pathetic coming from anyone, but from a woman who's a mother multiple times, it's even more sad and depressing. It's like watching an old drunk think that young guys are hitting on her in a bar, when in fact they're making fun of her. Madonna, please quit music (and writing, and acting, and what ever other garbage you may be planning on force-feeding brainwashed MTV viewers).
11 out of the twelve songs are simply amazing to me..
Great dance album, might be the best mainstream pop album this year
This album is so addictive... perfect.
Rereading some of the criticisms of this album...most seem more a dislike (or attack) of madonna vers her music this time around. This is an album of dance and yes there's silly lyrics but it's called Confessions on a Dancefloor......shouldn't that say what's she's doing....on purpose!!! I love the album except for two songs: Hung Up Amazing hook and more catchy after more listens and played loud in a dancefloor it's even better. Get Together Bit flat and not as many hooks and catches to it, but good song otherwise. Sorry Amazing hook and great song but by end lacks that extra level to make it a classic, but good. However, played LOUD it's better, and played in Nightclub 6am in London last weekend and club went MENTAL for it...so it will be a smash. Future Lovers Better after repeated listens....however, I've never been a fan of Mirwais's gimmicks...but the 70 influence and mood saves this. I Love New York Totally bizarre song but odd lyrics but it works somehow! Let It Will Be Not crazy about this song. Flat and uninspired but ok. Forbidden Love Interesting with touching mood. Jump LOVE LOVE LOVE the intro and mid of this song but falls a little flat by the end......just doesn't creap to the next level to make it a classic..but still good enough for a number 1. How High Good song but not great. Bit flat. Isaac Very odd song and reminds me of Secret of year's ago, and too similar to that but she's trying something different with the voices. Push HATE this song...it's like JLo rip off. Flat and goes nowhere, but has good hook and that's it. Like It Or Not The only other song I hate on this album.....if I was in a club and ended on this note I'd be furious..this is a dancefloor album and she should have ended on a high!!! Wild and crazy song...not this moody introspective song. Sorry would have been a better ending..or a song with a heavy base and loud crash of an ending.... Overall, Madonna is back and this is one of my fav albums in years....only 2 songs out of 12 which I dislike...and apparently she has a number of songs which didn't make this album..and with it's success I await Confession on a Dancefloor PART 2.
Could it be any more blatant that she's trying to make up for American Life's critical and commercial failure? Most of the rest of the world has moved on.
yes i hold up my hand it IS definately pissing over mariah carey but...................it still bores. Maddona seems crushed under a barrage of seemingly pointless beats and melodies while her pointless lyrics and effects betray the talented voice, not at all a good listen
I aint ever heard a full madonna album (1 of the minority!) but this album because of the beats and production has been in the cd player for the last few weeks as it is really, really good. You can put it on and the time flies all the tracks mix into 1 long happy tune. I love New York is the worst song in terms of lyrics but who cares as the beats still work even on this!
I drove three hours... and the music kept me going. Folks, play it loud and you will "feel" its power even better. This work also refers to a notion of artistic coexistence (Merce Cunningham Dance Company does it beautifully). At times it feels like you are listening to tunes from two sources, and they are doing their own thing. I loved it! Beautiful sound texture.
I was quite happy with it... I love how one song flows into the next. It might not take very long for me to get annoyed by it, but it is nonetheless quite an excellent album. To be honest, I actually really dislike Madonna for various reasons, but this is by far my favorite album.
Not great, not bad. Average. This latest effort from Madonna is a bit bleak in some areas, though there are some uber- funky dance mega hits packed in this pop CD. Its not classic Madonna, but hey, at least she doesn't sing for Britain about kaballah and how fabulous her life is.
Her best album ever!!! It brings her old school dance with her updated lyrics. Absolutely beautiful!!!
I don't get it. If any other artist released this, it would have been mildly praised for the studio work and criticized for the mediocre lyrics and vocals. Confessions fails to break any new creative ground, but it will please her die-hard legions of loyal fans. My advice? Move along... nothing to see here.
Suprisingly good. The material mom has gone full circle and come home to her roots (uh, the original brunette one's hahaha).
ewww....I though she was better then this.
Great album from start to finish! Congratulations Madonna.
It's great to see Madonna bangin' on the dancefloor again but on a dance/house music point of view, there's much better stuff out there. Think Mylo, Starsailor, Deep Dish, van Dyk and such.
fantastico album
Confessions on a Dance Floor is being billed by mainstream critics as a fluffy, care-free, exuberant disc, which to an extent, is true. However, club-hopping purists and disco/dance fanatics should be warned: This is not the same Madonna from 20 years ago rolling around on-stage in a wedding dress. The style of this album while very much clubby in feel, also demonstrates Madonna's maturity not only as an artist, but as a woman who can masterfully craft a dance-oriented disc that appeals to discerning adult listeners. My official review is here: http://www.digitalcontradiction.net/misc/confessions.html
Love the way the songs link to one another. Far better than American Life.
Oh dear. How UNDERWHELMED am I with this album...? Uninspired, soul-less and what is it with those lame lyrics ? Churning out yet another commercially glib collection of crap, I yearn for the Madge days of RAY OF LIGHT or BEDTIME STORIES. Just Hang Up why dontcha...?
This is not nonstop, it falls flat on "I Love New York" and "Issac." I do like the similarities between "Frozen" and the latter. The rest of the album is why I gave it a ten. From the catchy-non stop-move-it-ness of Hung Up, the ryhtms of Get Together, the techno beats on Sorry, the ambience of Future Lovers, the street feel of Like it or Not, the get-readiness of Jump, the cascade of Let it will be and Forbidden Loves to the song that moved my soul like no song ever has before-Push. I love her voice, its never sound better, she has such strength in combining love, motives, religion, etc on the Future Disco album "Confessions on a Dance Floor." It blends the past with the present better than anybody could.
Madonna's finest effort since Ray of Light, truly inspiring and a beautiful, fun listen.
Still love this after 3 years. Great album by Madonna. It doesn't miss a beat!!
Something you can listen from start to finish without skipping.
Certainly one of the best. Non-stop catchy dance tunes that have heart to satisfy all fans - new and old
Great, I love it so much.I can't belive it's Madonna.
This is a wonderful dance album. Every song is superb and the flow between each track is perfect. Highly recommended!
awesome album
Best Madonna album in the last decade.
It's simply a return to form. A return to her dancing roots and it's fun. Thank God for fun albums.
Critics shut the hell up... you always critisize Ms. Madonna... and she still keeps on selling records, having number ones.. instead of analizing her music and breaking it into piecese.. enjoy it... it's perfect to go out, to dance, to listen when you're at work... she's not a poet she tells you how it is... so back off... becaue she will sell at least a mil within two weeks.. I guarantee it...
Her best in a long time!!!
This Album is amazing! Madonna at her very best!! The Dancing queen is back!
As a whole, the best album of her career
This is by far Madonna's greatest album since Ray of Light. An amazing swirl of dance, techno and daft Punk, this album is one throb of a ride. Anyone who can resist the temptation to dance while listening to this, must be made of wood.
I'm Going to say it: This is the defining work of madonna's career. This album is perfection, in every sense, and madonna deserves all the positive recognition she is getting for it. It is superior to any dance record i have ever heard, and is without a doubt, the best record of 2005.
great all around dance/pop album
this album is really great, until the last 3 songs which in my opinion are no better than fillers. best album since Ray of Light for sure.
This is Madonna mixing fun with intelligence. Pure escapism. Love it!
One of my favorite albums of the year. For a dance album it's extremely consistant in terms of how each song is different from the other and there are no weak tracks in the album. I'd only say that Push, Isaac and Sorry are my least favorite songs, but they aren't even half-bad. Favorite tracks include: Jump Get Together Future Lovers I Love New York Forbidden Love
Incessantly catchy to the point of brilliance. It's Madonna at her very best: Confessions is meat-n-potatoes with a candy coating.
I was very excited by the idea of a continuous dance mix. Hand it to her to do a dance album when dance is at a low in popularity. As a whole it's pretty good, especially Get Together and Isaac, which surprisingly works. But there are stinkers, especially I Love New York, for instance, the lyrics are so insultingly dumb (and if there's irony there, i don't hear it) that it almost ruins the flow. It's not even funny to rhyme sad and glad and mad. It's just lame. I still prefer American Life... hehe.
Madonna outdid herself with this album. She is a genius in re-creating and transforming music and candy coat it to the world. Confessions is by far a solid intelligent album. Move away Mariah and JLo, this girl is all you need to dance and get your senses go wild.
A true return to form!
One of her best albums of all-time; combines the energy of Music, the sensibility of Ray of Light, and the expression of Like a Prayer.
Pure fun! Great album. I am experiencing the same excitement I had for Like A Prayer, Erotica, Bedtime Stories, Ray of Light, etc. Once again, I am having a Madonna moment.
Her best in years!! If you like dance/pop music you have to run out and get this now! What a complete treat this is for the ears. What are you waiting for? Go now and get your copy today!!!
Great Album - Madonna is amazing. "Jump" is going to be a huge hit, especially with her die-hard fans - I hope it's the next single!!!!
Her most non-stop and party-influenced album yet! And it still maintains some good lyrics, so you don't have to feel guilty while you dance.
She has such a deep understanding of dance music and dance culture. this album makes me giddy with excitment. I cannot wait to hear it on a dance floor!!
Madonna's experimentation with future disco is a total success. "Hung Up," "Sorry," "Jump," "Let It Will Be," and "I Love New York" are simply amazing songs.
Fantastic album! It's sexy, musically tight, thought provoking, and full of creative energy. It is one of Madonna's finest.
Best album. Intelligent! Her song writing talent has been unrated!
Has anyone else noticed that Let it will be sounds just like Die Another Day? WTF????
an album with empowering, high energy and a fresh sound that makes me boogie, a great album for asipiring dancers who need to lose weight.
The Best full collection of songs of any Madonna Album except for Ray of light. The effortless transition between songs along with the dazzleling sound make this the Album to play over and over and still fnd something new!
Madonna still kicks ass and looks sexy doing it.
Having a comment for this excellent work is unnecessary... I also love American Pie song
Amazing album, thank you Madonna.
Amazing return to form. 80's synth pop dressed up as disco-chic, but surprisingly progressive a la MUSIC. If you loved MUSIC or RAY OF LIGHT, you will LOVE this one.
After playing a losing game of trend-chasing on her past two albums, Madonna has returned to her electro-fishnet roots with a tremendous tour-de-dada-disco. What can you say about an album of bubblegum fantasy and frolic in an era of pervasive darkness and misanthropic entropy, but oh JOY! and RAPTURE! This icon has paddled back from the Bering Straits of ice-capped has-beenland to a "What you talkin', about Willis?" confimation of iconic stature. Her beats are quick, and her voice mother-earth melodic. She has always forged ahead with abandon, keeps us wondering what she's up to, and answers our questions in a style that's sometimes mystifying, but always resolute. God bless the lady. I would have the Queen Mother knight her if I had my way. Long live the Queen of Pop!
Naked madonna!!!lol
All hail the queen, A massive return to form
Her pseudo English accent continues to remove whatever flimsy credibility she ever had as a singer. Oops, did I say she "sings"? More like whining. At least if she's making records I don't have to be assaulted by her acting.
Cheers to Madonna for this stunning return to the party! Almost entirely eschewing any sort of messages she storms back into the club scene with this non-stop dance tour de force! What a shame several people who either hate pop/dance music or hate Madonna feel the need to post negative comments on here, most likely without even giving the disc a listen... Maybe they should visit a few more nightclubs and find something better to do with their free time.
Terribly fantastic , i couldn't drive my car withour her tunes now!
This album is truly an amazing dancing trip for Madonna fans. Madonna has surely proved herself and her music once again with fabulous numbers like push hung up get together forbidden love .... Madonna Rocks for real.....
Crappy copy-paste music. Madonna discovered a PC. Get Goldfrapp, its the original.
there's not much more to add to all the great reviews ... simply stated, the album's awesome!
Incredibly catchy record. Yes, she didn't break any pencils writing lyrics, but who gives a rat's ass. Pop it on your Ipod, and have a great rainbow-tastic gay workout. Pump those muscles bitches!
How can people still try to bring her down? Hasn't she proved herself by now? My God, 20-some years later and people are still trying to write her obit. Ridiculous! Just shut up, listen and shake your lame ass to her brilliant new disc, and you'll eventually admit it's fantastic. Long live the true queen of pop! Bite me Mariah!
This cd has 5 excellent tracks, 3 good, 2 mediocre, and 2 I won't even listen to. I am an avid Madonna Fan. This is not her best, and none of the other tracks will probably be remembered with exception to Hung Up- think "American Life." However, this cd does have commercial potential (remember "Love Profusion" for Esteee Lauder) and I could see some of these songs used in marketing campaigns. I am still waiting for that GREAT Madonna CD, one that will beat out Ray of Light and (my fave->) Music.
Great! Catchy! Fun! Dance happy. Everything music should be!!!!
amazing album with a great beat that grabs hold and lets up only to baptize you in the spirit, you will hear angels
No Doubt the best album that has hit all year.
Teach people to stunning original Madonna's music can still be so cool.
This album is one of those albums that feels like a story, meaning that the songs barely differ in quality. Although some such as "Push" and "How High" slightly dampen the feeling of, just well-made music, there's no saying that this woman isn't something of a prodigy.Selling in its truckloads, Madonna still has it; the ability to create more of what made her originally famous. Her music. She is still talented, is looking just as great as ever in the music videos, and has topped up her talent on dancing. We are forced to ask ourselves, is there anything this woman can't do?Still topping the charts almost 30 years on, every song has its catchiness and feel. A must-have for any fan of the legendary woman, a necessity in the form of a nice, old school Madonna album.
This is my favorite Madonna ALbum. My favorite song on the album is "Get Together". The album is something you can put on and enjoy anytime. I totally reccomend checking it out. Key Tracks: "Get Together" "Hung Up" "Jump" and "Sorry"
"Confessions" makes Madonna, I have to say... old....... But is old in the most elegant way that you could describe this album. "Confessions" is only one of those albums that you would expect to be featured in world records (Mind you "Ray of Light" and "Music" did have its turn as well). The album features the disco influenced track "Hung Up", the dreamy dance tune "Get Together", the risk taker song "Isaac" and the glossy elegant europop-ballad "How High".... Overall, the album is a keeper for a really long time.
this album made me love madonna because it features mesmerizing vocals and AMAZING beats. every song blends with the next one which makes this musical experience epic!
I honestly love this album, and would say it's one of my favourites by Madonna. Every track is worth listening to and the the songs get darker and darker as you go on the album, which is why the album is named thus. It starts out fun but then as you get more involved, it gets more and more personal. Standouts on the album are "Hung Up", "Forbidden Love", and "Isaac".
The best idea of this album is its interludes are fused in the ends of each song. The entirety makes it unstoppable. Also, each track sounds great separately!
Her best album since 'Ray of Light'. She and Stuart Price (and a couple of tracks by Bloodyshy & Avant and Mirwais) have created a dance-pop masterpiece. It's arranged to perfection, her voice is lush and controlled and Price's production is at it absolute best. It lacks upbeat numbers, but it's an escapist album, full of wonder and gorgeous sounds - almost visual in parts ('Issac').One of the most important dance records of the century.
Absolutely perfect. The most fantastic album ever made by a singer. The triumph of perfection, sounds and feels.From "Hung Up" to "Let it will be", every single song is mixed perfectly!I love Madonna since i heard this album.
NÃ£o esperava muita coisa quando baixei este Ã¡lbum, mas Madonna me surpreendeu novamente.Apesar de ser extremamente danÃ§ante, Confessions On A Dance Floor tem muito mais a oferecer.Future Lovers Ã© uma das melhores faixas da carreira da cantora. Like It Or Not e Let It Will Be tambÃ©m nÃ£o ficam atrÃ¡s.Certamente, esse Ã¡lbum nÃ£o Ã© o melhor de Madonna (talvez ela nunca possa superar o grandioso Ray Of Light), mas estÃ¡ entre os melhores, ao lado de Bedtime Stories e Like A Prayer.
RuPaul aside, someone else is goin' back to her roots. "Confessions" got her dancing again and though it's hardly original, she has laid down a few hits to feed contemporary dance pop. And it's more than just a mid-life crisis romp - it bears a certain depth and darkness we never heard before.
A masterpiece of dance music! Extremely consistant, has some of Madonnas finest lyrics, and is incredibly produced. It's not as easy to digest compared to releases like Ray of Light or Like a Prayer, since it's more of a hardcore dance album, but the beats are so great. It's Madonna's best album, and one of the best albums of all time.
She's confident, she's strong, she knows what she's doing and she's not apologizing for it. Built like a DJ set, "Confessions On A Dance Floor" doesn't let down.
Her best dance-pop album so far in my opinion, and her best album general after Ray of Light. Very good confessions I wanna hear to. You did it again Madge.
Confessions on a Dancefloor is one of those albums which you want to find flaws in, but just cannot. Madonna truly shines in this one. This album literally has no weak parts, and doesn't get boring for even a second. This and Ray of Light are the two perfect Madonna albums. I cannot find a single weak track here. All tracks are amazing. Personal favourites of mine are Let It Will Be, Jump and Isaac. Newcomers should get this before anything else by Madonna. Highly recommended, there's no album I would recommend more than Confessions
One of the best albums of 2005. Madonna brought dance music to the forefront of Pop music here, and she did an amazing job with it. Confessions has turned out to be her best effort of recent years. Excellent!
At old age, Madonna proved that she's still able to command everybody to dance in late-night parties. It is an amazing album, probably her best album to date. All the tracks are great! I think the highlights on this album are "Hung Up", "Sorry", "Forbidden Love", and "Isaac".
Menos polêmica do que anteriormente no seu disco "American Life", Madonna apresenta no seu "Confessions on a Dance Floor" um disco totalmente despretensioso, feito apenas para as pessoas dançarem. As letras falam em maioria sobre auto críticas e relacionamentos. O álbum cumpre bem o papel de manter o nome de Madonna firme no topo das paradas e agora também das baladas e o resultado é instantâneo: mais de 10 milhões de cópias vendidas mundialmente, muitos prêmios e uma de suas maiores turnês já feitas.
Amazing record. perfect for a dance floor. The Queen Of Pop surprises us again with a record so stomping you won't be able to stop listening to it
I like this album, but i don't get why people says this is Madonna's best album!! is dancy, catchy, but in my opinion there are some songs in the album that screw the whole record!
Not only there isn't a bad song in this album, also HUNG UP, SORRY, GET TOGETHER and JUMP are four timeless singles: arguably the best dance songs EVER!
One of the best albums I've ever heard. I somehow feel entranced listening to it, and it never gets boring. Even now, almost 9 years later this still has sounds relevant to today. The longevity is astounding.
Pegajosos ritmos e innovadoras letras hacen de este album una verdadera Confesión Sobre La Pista de Baile, quien se resista a no bailar en una disco con estos temas, no es un bailarín.
I confess, not on a dance floor, that this is my favorite Madonna album and one of the best of all time in my view. Sadly, the critics had a bit of a heyday with this album, coming on the heels of one they detested and that did badly by Madonna standards. But I would not be writing this except for Stephen Thomas Erlewien's Rovi critique in which he basically said Madonna had sold out.True, the album like so many by Sinatra and Como, sounds like the old Madonna, with a bit of electronics. What is wrong with that?In the end, many critics dislike the go-it-alone Madonna, which pokes its head out throughout Erlewine's review. Yet, Madonna, whose performance at the end of her 50s seemed lacking during last night's Grammy Awards, remains an icon of the age and music that matters and mattered so much to advancing individual women. Without her we might not have seen Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. And without her, we would have missed the vibrant scenes that moved so many to branch out."I Like New York" perhaps best demonstrates her views. Listen to it. It's worth the time. Then listen to the rest. Enjoy!
This album is pure perfection. Only Queen of POP could deliver such a pop masterpiece. I love whole concept of this, I love that all of it create w bigger whole, i love her lyrics, and that oriental vibe in it. Very original, fresh album, even now in 2013 it still sounds great!
Despite the fact she will never be as she once was, Madonna uses the full force of her talent and production team to bring this instant classic album. Sure to be remembered for years to come.
Um de seus melhores álbuns, compreendo que algumas letras são meio clichês, mas este álbum foi uma forma de Madonna se libertar e 'relaxar', cativante do início ao fim, destaque pra Sorry e Get Together.
the best album she ever made in the 2000´s a revolucionary record who is the inspiration to the new pop music, the lyrics are great, the music is perfect and the tour was incredible!
Confessions On A Dance Floor is certainly one of my favorite Madonna albums. It's an incredibly cohesive collection of dance songs that make you just wanna get up and move (which is especially great for working out). It sort of has an escapist vibe to it, with the songs being nice and long, as if they're remixes being played at a club, but this album still has momentum, making it thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.
One of my favorites by her. It was the last she did something different that the others and that's why it was her last hit album ...we need this Madonna back
For me is the best album from Madonna ever, superb production, fun, very danceble. I love it
Simply amazing. Loved all the songs and not a single one was boring or bad. Madonna really stood out in this album.
The whole album is brilliant but "Future Lovers" to "Forbidden Love" arc is just out of this world! The best minutes in Madonna's career. Godlike genius.
This Is definitely by far my favorite album by Madonna! Every track on this album is completely different and intriguing as well as innovative. This is one of her best works!
Madonna's tenth studio effort is about as catchy and wonderful as dance music gets. Beginning with some of the four strongest tracks ever, Confessions on a Dance Floor is utterly amazing. Opened by one of the best dance tracks of the decade, "Hung Up" is a smart track with a heavy sample of ABBA. "Get Together" adds fuel to the fire with surprisingly perfect clichés and soft beats. Second single "Sorry" is extremely listenable and pays homage to Pet Shop Boys and European-esque music. Ending the 4 is "Future Lovers", a big enough track to be single-worthy. "I Love New York"'s attacking-nature may be a bit much for some, but honestly enough, "Let It Will Be" brings things back up to speed without going overboard. "Forbidden Love" is destined to be on repeat for days, and ironically enough, features a sample from her 1995 track of the same name, "Forbidden Love". The empowering "Jump" is a club showstopper, but lacks the excitement concealed in "Hung Up" and "Sorry". "How High" talks of wealth and potential, which feels like a mockery, a bit reminiscent of her 2003 album, American Life. The religious-inspired, "Isaac" is quite strong for being the so-called "outlier" of the album, but fortunately starts and ends on an extremely strong note. "Push" and "Like It or Not" are similar in style, but differ in lyrics. The former is quite catchy, while the ladder features clichés that were better fitted on "Get Together", but suit well here too. The bonus track, "Fighting Spirit" is also a worthy track."Hung Up" and "Forbidden Love" definitely stand out in this album. Although "I Love New York" may come on a bit too strong, it is most definitely not a bad track.Greats:- "Hung Up"- "Forbidden Love"Nadirs:- "I Love New York"Overall Rating: 10/10
Maddona 2005 album is a pop sensation with cool dance beats likeHung up, and sorry. I recommend this album for maddona fans and pop music fans. 10/10
Texturas asombrosas, produccion impecable, uno de los mejores albumes de Madonna, es tan perfecto, como usa samples de otras canciones como Donna Summer o ABBA, its simply delicious...
Confessions on a Dance Floor is certainly one the best Pop albums of all time. Songs like "Hung Up" and "Sorry" are stunning. With the dance beats, disco atmosphere and her magical voice; she commands her listeners.
Es el mejor disco Pop Femenino de la década del '00 : "Hung Up", "Sorry" y "Get Together" en mi opinión son las mejores canciones del álbum. Esta producción influenció mucho a futuros albumes como "The Fame" de Lady Gaga y " X" de Kylie Minogue
This is for sure Madonna's best album in years because she has done an enjoyable but not aggressive electronic album. Its mixing of Dance-Pop, Euro music, Electronic music, Disco and House music with also elements of indie dance in its last tracks makes this album relaxing and danceable at the same time.
Madonna was inventing and pioneering a new era for electro dance music, thank you for this album Madonna.
Absolute masterpiece in the club music discography, not only Madonna's. Catchy, timeless, charming beats and melodies intertwined with known samples and meaningful lyrics. You like dance music, you'll love "Confessions on a dance floor".
"Confessions On A Dance Floor" Madonna - stunning. To be honest, when I started to get acquainted with the Madonna with her album "MDNA" I do not want to hear of her previous albums. I later regretted, because I heard this album. It is so conceptual, soft, passes through me like a waterfall. I really like the song - "Sorry", "Push" "Like it or Not". The song "Hung Up" my childhood. You could say that I knew from years 5-6 this motive, and a year ago found this wonderful songTo me, Madonna opened with this album with the other hand.
I really like this album, even if at times some tracks appear to be thrown together with DJ mixes to "sound good." I don't think it's her best, that would be Ray of Light. However, the effort put forth into this album as compared to American Life, or Bedtime Stories, certainly proves that it's not all about her image.
CONFESSIONS ON THE DANCE FLOORExcellent album by Madonna, I recommend this for everyone, it's art after art, something normal in Madonna. Madonna if she brings us pure pop art.
It is a brilliant disc that lacked very little circulation in the radios and of bad critics where they did not criticize the album if not to the new image of madonna, thus putting to the disc in a bad punctuation, although in some songs the disc decays to a Point where there was no return and forced much to recover that retro disco environment containing the album

Puede ser un álbum bastante movido para la edad de Madonna en aquellos tiempos, pero no dejo de sorprendernos, para nada. Este es un álbum que marco la era del pop, es un pop totalmente lleno de arte, arte en su máxima expresión.
So time goes by slowly. This album are disco album from the 1970-1980 years. I love Hung up and Sorry and Forbidden Love. This is masterpiece. Why not?
THE DEFINITIVE BIBLE OF POP FOR THE 2000'S!Disco era was so GOOD and this album makes his greatest comeback!
Confessions On A Dance Floor is all about that, Madonna opening his heart to the dance floor in front of all of us. Dance, pop anthem, neon, bright, party, but also very deep and thought and concious of that. While his beats remain on your mind you were invited to a big party, alone or not. With a lot of textures and a full pallete from its colors, all the songs work perfectly together, One of the best POP album of all times.
Confessions... is vocally sharp and (at times) lyrically breathtaking, but it is difficult to imagine this album working without Price's involvement. The joyful "I Love the '80s"-style disc fans have been yearning for since she took up yoga.Easily dance record of the year, Confessions is an almost seamless tribute to the strobe-lit sensuality of the '80s New York club scene that gave Madge her roots, which she explores with compelling aplomb.
Indispensável nas baladas, Confessions on A Dancefloor fez e faz jus ao seu nome. Com músicas disco super animadas (e geralmente com a voz da Madonna no fundo fazendo suas "confessions") faz qualquer um dançar loucamente. Muitas músicas têm mais de 4:30 minutos de duração, deixando o álbum um pouco difícil de se ouvir se não estiver numa balada. E muitas soam repetitivas além do limite.Destaques: pra hinária "Hung Up". "Isaac" com sua língua estrangeira deu um toque diferente ao álbum e "Push" com uma pegada diferente e sexy. (com direito a repeat)
One ofnher best releases in her later years post her commercial peak. Through investing itself in the hot sweaty depths of the dance floor it unfolds like a fun rhythmic testimony t9 letting go. This is not a masterpiece but it doesn't need to be.
PIECE OF ART. Incredible setlist from begining till the end. GREATEST FEMALE ARTIST EVER.
"Confessions on a Dancefloor" is one of the greatest comebacks of all time. It was released two years after its underrated predecessor "American Life", which underperformed for Madonna's standards. While "American Life" discussed the American Dream and materialism, Madonna decided to make a less serious album with "Confessions on a Dancefloor". Instead, she created one of the best dance albums of all time. Its iconic lead single "Hung Up" remains one of the best uses of a sample ever. That ABBA sample is pure genius. I don’t need to say much about the song itself. Everyone knows it, everyone loves it. A classic.The album's second single "Sorry" is my favorite track on the album. You just have to dance when that one comes on. Another highlight is "Forbidden Love". Madonna had already released a song with that name 10 years prior on "Bedtime Stories" but this one is the superior song by far. It's more of a midtempo song and it’s just beautiful."Isaac" kind of reminds me of Madonna's magnum opus "Ray of Light". It’s an incredible, hypnotic track."Like It or Not" is a great closing track for the album, which talks about the crossroads of past, present and future. The album gets a little silly with "I Love New York" but even that song is great and has an incredible production. This album is a masterpiece and it’s remarkable how Madonna managed to pull off such a successful era and such an outstanding album 23 years into her career. I love how all the songs blend into each other. Madonna proved once again that she’s the Queen of Pop with this masterpiece and this album's impact can still be felt today, just look at Dua Lipa's "Future Nostalgia" album. Another timeless and influential record in Madonna's legendary repertoire.Favorites: Sorry, Forbidden Love, Hung Up & Isaac
Confessions On A Dance Floor é eletrizante e mostra que Madonna soube se achar na sonoridade da dance-music dos anos 2000.
uno de los mejores álbumes de madonna, es tan a temporal y con unos ritmos increibles
O melhor álbum da Madonna dos anos 2000, ficando atrás apenas de álbuns como Erotica e Ray of Light.Esse álbum dançante torna a discografia da Rainha do pop ainda mais impecável e invejável.
Uno de los mejores albums de Madonna , sonido realmente innovador , letras poderosas y sobretodo te pueden poner a bailar en donde estés ! Sin duda el mejor álbum del año 2005
Madonna delivers an outstanding album and timeless album. Pure excellence!
The best dance album ever ! The production of the songs is amazing ! There is so many anthems on this album. It never gets old !
Альбом считается "лучшим" в карьере многими людьми, однако он, как по мне, немного переоценен и ставить его в ряд "Like A Prayer" и "Ray Of Light" просто неуместно, однако диско звучание, к которому она вернулась вернуло ее на олимп успеха. Шедевральные синглы, но много средних треков, которые не имеют никакого веса.
Need we say more? The Bible for the pop dance music. The highest selling female album WW in 2005, the highest-selling single in 2005 (hung up), the highest grossing tour, and the highest paid female artist, Madonna did that in the THIRD decade of her career.
Her best album ever after Ray of Light also this album is for me the best pop album of 00’s. First three songs are the bests but also Forbidden Love, Jump, Isaac, How High, Like It or Not are so good. I cant say other tracks are not good cuz we should look at this as a whole, the non-stop version just proves it and as a whole the album is a legend. I wish Madonna came with this stuff but Madame X also not the worst and we shouldnt wait too much from her at that age like she doesnt have to prove herself anymore she already did it too many times. Long live the Queen
One of the 5 best album by Madonna. All tracks are beautiful. my favourite 3 tracks is Forbidden Love, Isaac and Push
My favourite album from Madonna . Perfect music production ♥️i love This album so much
Queen of pop doing what she's the best at. A timeless dance pop record that has huge hits that everyone can sing their lyrics like national anthem. She gave us a great concept, incredible production and an unforgettable tour after it. One of the greatest pop albums of all time!
One of her best albums. Great production and vocals. A very pop, disco, electronic sound. Several samples from older music from the 1980’s.
greatest dance album of all time...madonna and stuart did that....deserves everything
The best album ever! The beat is very unique, bring us to the 80s. Is time to putt a dance shoes and enjoy the party.
Incredible work of genius! Confessions On A Dance Floor is a timeless album and its audiovisual concept continues to influence new albums even now in 2020 like Dua Lipa's latest "Future Nostalgia" and "Chromatica" by Lady Gaga. It has become a reference in dance music.
Madonna fails to deliver pop art. She tries but fails so much! It's the worst álbum ever. She needs to reinvent herself. She needs more bops. She also needs good people to Write ver songs!!!! Let's teu, madonna!
COADF is definitely the best and my personal favourite Madonna's album. Every single song on this body of work is so timeless, fresh-sounding and groovy. Madonna did outdo herself with it. She did so, with choosing the singles as well. Hung Up is - for me - her best song to date. Well, Madonna using ABBA's sample - a song of decades is on its way. Other singles are flawless too - especially Get Together - mesmerizing, disco-seducing and hypnotizing dance track which I recommend to listen to with a good headphones. Sorry and Jump are beyond perfect as well. For anyone who is about to start Madonna's Discography Journey - this is the best possible album to begin with. Unfortunately it's her last consistent and THAT great album so far.
A legendary album! The disco and the modern electronic dance music mix makes this album totally nostalgic but also timeless! Madonna at her peak
Una joya musical, un álbum que salió justo en el furor del R&B, este álbum es simplemente fenomenal
A frente de seu tempo.. isso aqui foi uma limpeza de imagem da melhor espécie!!! Hung Up segue sendo atemporal. É impressionante como esse álbum envelhece como vinho
It proves why Madonna is the queen of pop and made a whole new generation of people loved her with a whole new concept of pop.
best album of his career with cohesion and connection in all his tracks, time passes so fast and I am happier when I hear this work.
Arguably one of her best bodies of work. It's impressive how this album inspired so many others to come, just like Future Nostalgia by Dua Lipa, for an example. Overall, it is a very good dance album, not to mention having one of the biggest hits of the 00's: Hung Up.
Muy bueno de la reina de pop, mierga desea un álbum tan artístico como confessions on a dance floor.Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
One of the best pop queen albums, unfortunately the last great album, after it nothing relevant was released.
This album is perfect from start to finish! There is no bad music! I love him!
It's one of two Madonna's magnum opuses, with the second one being 'Ray of Light' (1998). While 'Ray of Light' is more down-to-earth, beautiful sounding record, 'Confessions on a Dance Floor' are living to its title - with killer lyrics (confessions) to really groovy dance music! It's one of the best concept albums out there!The amount of clasics here is undeniable - "Hung Up", "Sorry" are at album's begining, sandwiching "Get Together". "Hung Up" is riding 70's disco and even though it's long (it runs for more than 5 mins), it's enjoyable all the way through. Lyrics here are less important, because that groove is simple unstoppable. Unlike the second track, which of course features pretty nice production, but words here are more important - wanting love. Lyrically, it's weird that it's followed by "Sorry", but hey - at least that song rules sonically. You can forget about lyrics and lose yourself to it and just dance!"Future Lovers" is really artsy track, while "I Love New York" is dorky. Another song that you can lose yourself into is "Let it Will Be", so infectious. "Forbidden Love" (another in Madonna's discography) has really cool retro athmosphere, and it aged like a fine wine! "Jump" is similar to "Get Together", with bigger emphasis on its lyrics, but groove here is pretty sweet too! "How High" seems like a good progression from "Jump" on title-level, while in "Issac" it's really hard to not lose yourself into Madonna's "mmms" - so lovely. "Push" is straight-forward acknowledgement of that other people are needed in our lives, while "Like it Or Not" is quite different - much subdued + it's like a middle finger to haters, more dance-y "Human Nature" (1995) if you will.Album's bonus tracks are good too - especially "Super Pop". Even though is the "list" type of song, it's pretty enjoyable, while "Fighting Spirit" can be hard to like for someone who doesn't enjoy auto-tune.
when i heard ''hung up'' before the album i must say it was really good it's not her best album but i still like it
t.A.T.u. does pure sensual pop like nobody else can even fucking hope.
First time I bought this, I almost drowned to sleep because I thought that was boring.But after the third time I put it on,I have to say this is a good album. Though I still like their first album better, they absolutely still made it to my favorite musicians/singers list.For those who dissed them, get a life.there are lots of worse than worst albums out there.But not this one for sure.
Outstanding
tATu begin to outgrow the lesbian shtick, and they are better off without it. Their voices seem more at ease singing the new material. For some reason, they shy away from two-part harmonies which could only make the songs more powerful. The outstanding tracks are as follows: "Gomenasai," their apology to their Japanese fans who were treated to a circus rather than a performance. "Crave," a gentle and mornful song about two girls who can't get their priorities in life straight. Also there is the thoroughly enjoyable "Friend or Foe," which carries the story of a strained friendship on a catchy melody that reminded this listener of the best James Bond theme songs. Many reviewers are using their first album - with its thinner choice of memorable songs - as a measuring stick for "Dangerous and Moving." The new album surpasses the old and is free of the artificial controversy created by tATu's former hack manager Ivan Shapovalov. The end result is a collection of songs that have a true erotic allure. It's doubtful that the tATu act will survive long enough to produce a third album, but one can always hope.
better than all the albums this year
It's pretty good actually. they've improoved a lot, at least the songs have a theme, better music arrangement, pretty cool sound very melodic and different. Although it has 1 or 2 songs that are not too good, i have to say that its a good album overall. of course for those who knows what voice and melodies are, and the girls have those that some others wish.
As a mainly pop-oriented album. I think TATU girls did a good job this time. Catchy as usual, the first single All About Us has such a killer-tune that you can never mistake them as other pop singers, and the strong melody is always their symbol. And the album contains other catchy tunes also, such as Friend Or Foe, She Loves Me Not, and the ballad Gomenasai is just a lovely and warming song for teenagers. I think it's a great pop album, and I am pretty amased the two girls could've done this, again.
This is one the best Cds i've listened to. t.A.T.u has definetly made there comeback. This album shows that theses two aren't jsut little school girls anymore but they're women who express themsleves in the awsome song lyrics. I'm mean the first time i heard gomenasai it moved me to tears. Simply put a Kick ass album
They are relly fantastic. I'm from Iran.This album with "Sacrifice" , "All about us" and "Outer space" is the best of them.
Its a wonderful disc if you dont like tatu you dont like the pop music its good music powerful lyrics perfect music and voices the people and magazines that say that this is a so bad disc they dont know nothing about music
I love this album. There are a couple of weak songs, but otherwise the album is very cohesive. Their production values are top notch as well. Their instrumentation is full and complex. I know people love to hate them, but it wouldn't hurt to simply give them the credit they are due.
i love the songs. The melody and the lyrics are just great! Very meaningful lyrics.
t.A.T.u. is fucking awesome! It isn't just about lesbians its about love. the kind that can completly enslave a person with passion, unrestraind lust love envy and so much more. Naturally the second album cant compete with the first (200 Km/h in the Wrong Lane) but Dangerous and Moving has a lot more value than some of the other music you hear on the radio. Their new hit "All About Us" has its strong points but it isnt the most sensational track on the cd so you should buy it and find out which one is.
I love tatu, and I love this CD. Best listened too on drugs. :)
I think everybody critic in bad these best pop group don't understand nothing!! Only invidious or understandable comments. I 've dscoverd that know i love these TEEN and i listen every day to thei new single "All about us". It's a MASTERPIECE
great ........
t..A.T.u. created quite a stir when they arrived in 2002; they used every on-camera opportunity they got to advertise their apparent romantic relationship, and their addictive, dark pop was striking a chord with audiences-enough to move over 5 million copies of their debut, 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane. Three years later, the Russian super-duo returns with a new look, new sound, and a better approach. Opting for artistic credibility this time around, they
No other album has released full force of euro pop like tatu,who has become a pop phenomenon.Dangerous and Moving & loves me not are the solid tracks this exhilirating album has to offer.Bring on the third
Absolutely the very best album in the whole music industry in 2005. It is a real disappointment that the group no longer exist. I hope there will be back soon.
This album is probably one of the best albums released in 2005. The music is enjoyable, and the voices are brilliant. The songs from this album will stick in your head. Say no more, say no less.
Very listenable but too safe. No real standouts like on their debut (nothing close to Show Me Love). Not a bad disc but it sounds like the record company is phasing the girls out based on the cloudy production. You could buy worse CDs but I'd suggest saving your money. I bought it for $8.99 and I had to find out because I loved the first one so I don't have buyers remorse. Buy Royksopp instead.
Nice image, terrible sound: this is as good as pop music gets. And the RIAA wonders why sales are down 8%.
what a load of crap these 2 r as fake as jordans tits!!!!!!!!!!!
Maybe not the best album by them, but really really good, because it has mixed music styles - if you want rock, pop, new age (well, just one song... kinda) or some catchy pop, D&M has it.
Why waste your money on this product when you can buy real porn at your corner store?
Fucking great album! That's so much better than by Lindsay, Britney, Ashley or by any other American chick. Well arranged, produced and written. Simply pop as it's best. tATu has definitely established their succuess in Europe and worldwide.
Ok, it's an improvement. A couple songs, like "Cosmos (Outer Space)," rock nicely. But there's still too much repetition, and they aren't good singers.
Even those who prefer rock music will agree that this is the best kind of pop there is, it's not bubble gum and it's not poser punk.
Dangerous and moving is a great album and it shows there's good pop music.
Although lacking a song of the same calibre as their cover of The Smiths How soon is now, and although it has a monotonous feel about it, it is nevertheless a great popalbum, with terrific tunes and a nice production. What more do you want from good popmusic?
Gotta love critics!! Here I read Billboard and Dot Music bashing this album...but what do they know?! This album is not half as bad as they say. In fact, it's pretty good, except for a few weak tracks maybe. You want crap? Get Ashlee Simpson's newest. Production-wise, everything has improved. It sounds beefier, songs are well written and the girls have improved their english pronunciation!
simple great !!!!!
I like this band like I like Abba. The hissy fits of some of these critics are obviously self-serving: Apparently they're trying to gain credibility the easiest and cheapest way they can. Here critics, here's some Creed, why don't you go over there with it and bash it to your heart's content, out of our earshot. We think your taste is impeccable, we promise. There, there, run along now.
Amazing!Fantastic!Unusual!Very interesting!better than all the albums this year!i love the songs. The melody and the lyrics are just great! Very meaningful lyrics.
This is one of the best albums by t.A.T.u. Outstanding music, great lyrics and beautiful girls. Favorite song from album is "Cosmos (Outer Space)". Unfortunately, this song not be released as single. Also, I like songs "Friend or Foe", "Sacrifice" and "Craving (I Only Want What I Can't Have)".
"Dangerous and Moving" - top to bottom scored solidly worked out pop album tracks foreign production focused primarily on Western audience, and slightly less on the local (Russian) listener.
The album is fine. it has a different style. Every song is solid and powerfully!
*Yes, I am aware I am reviewing this nearly 15 years after it's first release date, I just like to review albums for fun*While the Russian-pop duo t.A.T.u. did not release a worldwide hit like "All The Things She Said" with their debut album "200 km/hr In The Wrong Lane," this album is full of solid songs. These songs include All About Us, Cosmos (Outer Space), Gomenasai, Sacrifice, Perfect Enemy, and the title track, Dangerous and Moving. These are all very solid songs with great vocals and instrumentals. They have a clearly distinct style in the pop industry and it is not your typical pop or bubblegum pop. While they did not get nearly as much attention this era, I think the album is still solid and especially great to listen to in the car!
It's OK. Approach with caution.
amazingly cool, coherently a mess, lots of fun.
This is a much needed, very cute, and happy collection of songs; which just fits in perfectly, in balancing out every other Radiohead depression I have in my collection. It really is nice to have a breather every once in awhile. 10/10
Has totally inspired me to listen to wider ranges of music its so good. Uplifts me right away.
Its sounds like a bunch of 70's tv tunes all mixed into one. I've saw them live as well, that was even more disappointing
Sorry but this is way better than the Avalanches... Just lisen to Ladyflash or Pantherdash! Recalls the sixties in glorous stereo, a magnificent colelction of songs and one of the better debutes to come out this decennium. Word.
This albums full of catchy, less standard tunes where the vocals aren't as apparent as they usually are, and there is a heavy focus on the instrumentation. Also, Joe D is full of crap because I saw them live too and they were amazing and full of energy. It was also cool that they would switch instruments between songs.
Huddle Formation's awesome.
Reasonably inventive with a refreshingly retro edge. Choatic and busy. Some great tunes but as an album this is ultimately a bit samey, and one gets a nagging sense of "style-over-substance". Still one of the more interesting bands around at the moment, and worth a listen.
A must have album, the best of 2005
the beautiful theory of chaos. like the music from the old police series...
without a doubt the best album of the year.
If great sex was music, this is what it would sound like.
Totally raw soul and power.
ok at first but doesn't quite last over repeated listens.most of the songs lack a depth that they try to aspire to.
Their joy goes to eleven.
Pretty solid. Panther Dash is Sonic Youthish. Ladyflash is probably the best tune. Feelgood by Numbers is like Charlie Brown Christmas with a shitload of snare. We Just Can't Be Defeated is the cheerleader-overkill song. Junior Kickstart is really 70's cop showish. Friendship Update is a great song. This is a download-half-ditch-the-rest kind of album.
I thought i was in for a treat when i bought this. All the rave reviews from the critics and people on this website. Very disappointing. One of those albumson first listen that you keep waiting for a good track to kick in....... This album needs some BASS. I thought there was something up with my stereo, but no, just lacks some bass. to be compared with The Avalanches was a cruel way of getting me to part with my money. Not in the same league. They get 4 for being 'happy' unlike me.
the sonic equivalent of a box of crayons in a blender, without the blender noise. And the blender's going over a waterfall. And the crayons were stolen.
A standout album of 2005 because of it's inventive ideas and catchy riffs. The album is not music but is an overall show in your bedroom. You listen and enjoy but still it has some pros and cons. The pros standout the most but the cons always come in there. For example sometimes the album will sound as if no one is trying at all as if it is a mess that doesn't work and is not beautiful but ugly. A pro would be the unusual cheerleading anthems that are placed in this hell of a good album. I hope their sophomore effort is as interesting as their first.
Nice! almost as nice as the debut of The Avalanches or The Brothers Gonna work it out by Chemical Brothers.
Makes me so happy i want to cry.
Hands down the catchiest album of the year. Makes you wanna get up and shake that ass! "We Just Won't Be Defeated" is my theme song. ONe of the year's ten best.
This sounds like a strange, compelling mix of my bloody valentine and junior senior...I actually prefer the instrumental tracks like the fifth track which is awesome! Anyone into contemporary indie stuff will be delighted with this album!
Innovative, remarkable. You can't sit without your feet tapping, leg bobbing, or head nodding to the music. One of the best expressions of noise I've heard in some time, and it makes you happy.
like cheerleaders with a back-up band, playing to a high school gymnasium filled with sugar-shivered teens. Which is fine, if you like that kind of thing. More overhyped than the Shins.
Catchy and fun is such a rare thing these days!
It's a summer friday night, I've just drunk 2 litres of Red Bull and I'm bounding down the streets in low gravity boots yelling meaningless silly things at random people, kissing strangers, leaping over cars and trees and occasionally bouncing into others doing the same thing. THIS IS OUR SOUNDTRACK!!!!
spectacular spectacular. one of the best groups in 2004
Retro-Adrenaline-Cheerleader-SuperHappyFun-DancingTime-Punk-Powerpop! Listening to this is like mainlining an IV of pure happiness into your veins and setting all your muscles to boogie mode. What could be better?
A sound revolution. The people who rated this album poorly obviously did not take time to actually listen to it. They probably played it in the background while doing homework or making dinner. This album DESERVES to be avidly paid attention to. Every song is inspiring, and complexly layered. It's amazing, the fact that so many genres and instruments were combined but the album was never demeaned to some jumble of noise. The songs sound like they were recorded by elaborate pop/indie/hip-hop/dance beat orchestras. While this may not be the best album of '05, it is most definitely ONE of the best.
Great energy and tons of attitude. One of the best new bands around.
i think the Go Team are awesome, and this album is nifty
Instantly loveable! This album is bouncy, flamboyant and sometimes mad. More bands need to be as individual and fun as The Go! team.
Uplifting, crazy, dance-a-thonic... I love every second of it!
12" of pure energy
There's always been something mysterious and strange in agent films. Yeah, I like this indeed and especially those faster songs.Keep up the flag!
Short and sweet. This lp makes me want to smile each time i hear it
This totally took me by surprise. Wow this is revoluntionary.
This is the music that superheroes listen too, inspired with the unabashed the sheer size of the music. Nothing can compete with the Go! Team for sheer energy and joy.
Wow.
Unlike most anything I've heard. The ability to vocally synth the way they do makes this an musically and technically advanced album.
Think of the excellent "Avalanches" but turn the fun factor up to 111. This should have you bopping non-stop - blazing across the sky like a fabulous supersonic phoenix. Best album release of the past 3 years - Great live performers too!
Horrible, loud, stupid, insipid, low-fi garbage... and that's being kind. This is the kind of crap pretentious know-it-all (meaning "know nothing") rock reviewers without talent or ears put on their best lists to be thankfully forgotten by the following year and shortly thereafter found en mass in a used bin for $2 and no takers.
This CD is amazing. The mere catchyness that the songs have will bring the listener back and back for more Great music. If you want some great pop melodies look no further than this album. TRUST ME (John D- TV tunes??? i hear music with melody.)
gets real old real quick but the energy thats there is pretty impressive.
great debut album from this group. every song was good. it was original and creative. their sound is new and refreshing. looking forward to downloading their new release.
rubbish
Awesome album has 5 gold start rock solid hits, and the rest is pretty killer. All killer no filler.
dynamite is a fantastic album!!its so dynamic and it makes you wanna move!!
while its the same formula, it still sounds good. they just keep doing what they do best, but i found this one more enjoyable than the last. these later releases are nothing compared to the first couple albums, but they are still enjoyable.
Not Spacecowboy, but there are some funk moments that don't come out anywhere else these days (listen to the bass line of Dynamite). Very indulgent music, and keep an open mind for old school soul choir cheese lyrics.
Easily my favorite album of 2005. The beats are as catchy (and at times, as complex) as you'll find in recent house or R&B, without veering from the funk backbone of the Jamiroquai standard. I defy you to give it a listen without groovin'. "Dynamite" will blow you away! (Excuse the pun.)
Best album since "traveling without moving". They finally found the funk again.
1 or 2 misses but The quality of the other songs make up for of it.Any one who does not feel uplifted by these songs and arrangements should just stick to reviewing Britney,Justin and all the ohter crap that passes for music these days!
How could this album go bad? It's the best funk mu sic brought from t he 70's, updated with the sound of today. Is not so easy to do that- D! (dyego)
This album has alot of very well polished tunes that are timless which makes Jamiroquai unique. It has alot of seventies disco dance feel to it so if you like that, you will like this album. it is my favoutrate after travelling without moving.
After the lead single its pretty much business as usual. I thought they may try pull out all the stops before their greatest hits is released. We all knew about the album deal with Sony, and Jamiroquai didnt quite take on the world I once hoped they would. The never really progressed beyond a point they hit many years ago.
3 years later and WOW! Matured/dance funky/more edgy guitar riffs/sometimes smooth/ definitely Jay Kay. Reminded me of when I first listened to Muse's "Absolution" album, "This is better than anything out there." Original sounding.
Such a funky, sexy album. Excellent musicianship--oh my, the bass! The voice! The woodwinds! Could listen to it all day. Especially love "Love Blind," "Tallulah," "Star Child," and "Feels Just Like it Should."
I have a two CD album of Jamiroquai. This singer is the most visible and known ambassador of the music he makes. Very like the Beatles, but this is not pop music. His music is simple, and he appreciates the same, and repeats the lyrics, and the tune, very visibly at the lines, which would be a chorus in a singing group.
Amazing CD. I have been waiting for her second CD for a long time. It is definitely "mixed" in genres, but, that is part of the beauty of it all.
Esthero is an amazing artist. Truly an inovative album.
Esthero took 7 years for this? It's not a bad album, it's just I was expecting more from her. Her first album was revolutionary in a sense. This album she seems confused. She abandons her eletronic/trip-hop/samba stlye fo average R&B.
Ho-hum. A few good moments, but my finger tends toward the skip button frequently. The spoken-word poetry has got to go. Prefer Gwen Stefani for neo-flapper style.
I've been looking for a new sound to embrace, and I've found it in Esthero! She's definatly merged several music styles into something provocative.
Can't say much for this album. Gwen Stefani wannabe songs, interspersed with self indulgent answering machine messages. Pass.
Definitely worth the wait. Totally different from Breath From Another, but still incredibly entertaining and diverse.
Esthero is everything that the mainstream pop artists should aspire to be. She was making the black Eyed Peas better long before anyone knew who Fergie was, and can easily sing circles around most of her contemporaries. However, Esthero does it HER way, which means she'll be obscure in her career, but will still be able to live with herself.
Very eclectic!
I love this album ...it makes you just wanna smile with a raised eyebrow
I have waited for this cd for a while like most of us ....Esthero is amazing anyone who does it their way rocks .
this album was put together so smoothly and just has such a quality that no other artist could pull-off. I'm not really sure what the album didn't get such a good review by the critics, it bottles my mind. I LOVE this album and i LOVE Esthero!!
